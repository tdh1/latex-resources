abstract = {Smart manufacturing promises to provide significant increases in productivity and effectiveness of manufacturing systems by better connecting the data from people, processes, and things. However, there is no uniform, generalized method for deploying linked-data concepts to the manufacturing domain. The literature describes and commercial vendors offer centralized data-repository solutions, but these types of approaches quickly breakdown under the intense burden of managing and reconciling all the data flowing in and out of the various repositories across the product lifecycle. In this paper, we introduce a method for linking and tracing data throughout the product lifecycle using graphs to form digital threads. We describe a prototype implementation of the method and a case study to demonstrate an information round-trip for a product assembly between the design, manufacturing, and quality domains of the product lifecycle. The expected impact from this novel, standards-based, linked-data method is the ability to use digital threads to provide data, system, and viewpoint interoperability in the deployment of smart manufacturing to realize industry's {\$}30 Billion annual opportunity.},

abstract = {Product lifecycle management (PLM) systems have been gained application at leading areas of industry. By now, they integrate all engineering activities. Product definition in these systems relies upon advanced object modeling and virtual prototyping. However, large models with thousands of strongly related objects brought new problem of thinking and seeing in extensive information structures. New methods are demanded mainly to establish better organized knowledge based parallel interactions by high number of engineers. Fortunately, recent developments in product modeling introduced rules, reactions, function structures, and other active knowledge carriers in product models in order to establish situation and event based product definition. These techniques serve storage and repeated application of engineering knowledge and offer good connection for enhanced knowledge based communication between model generation processes and group work environment in the future. The authors of this paper established a new methodology for enhanced knowledge based connection of human interactions with current product modeling. They utilized their former results and realized coordinated interacting human intent based and product behavior driven adaptive product object definition. The proposed new control of product definition is supported by extended context definition. In this paper, the authors introduce the new product definition methodology and discuss key issues including principle of their Coordinated Request based Product Modeling (CRPM), connection of CRPM to the currently prevailing Classical Product Modeling (CPM), new representations in product behavior related structures, and a new method for the definition of coordinated contextual structure of objectives (SOB) and behaviors (SBE). The proposed modeling is considered as API communicated extension to the CPM modeling in current industrial PLM systems. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

@article{Rachuri2006,
abstract = {The important issue of mechanical assemblies has been a subject of intense research over the past several years. Most electromechanical products are assemblies of several components, for various technical as well as economic reasons. This paper provides an object-oriented definition of an assembly model called the Open Assembly Model (OAM) and defines an extension to the NIST Core Product Model (NIST-CPM). The assembly model represents the function, form, and behavior of the assembly and defines both a system level conceptual model and associated hierarchical relationships. The model provides a way for tolerance representation and propagation, kinematics representation, and engineering analysis at the system level. The assembly model is open so as to enable plug-and-play with various applications, such as analysis (FEM, tolerance, assembly), process planning, and virtual assembly (using VR techniques). With the advent of the Internet more and more products are designed and manufactured globally in a distributed and collaborative environment. The class structure defined in OAM can be used by designers to collaborate in such an environment. The proposed model includes both assembly as a concept and assembly as a data structure. For the latter it uses STEP. The OAM together with CPM can be used to capture the assembly evolution from the conceptual to the detailed design stages. It is expected that the proposed OAM will enhance the assembly information content in the STEP standard. A case study example is discussed to explain the Usecase analysis of the assembly model.},

abstract = {Recent advances enable data from manufacturing systems to be captured and contextualised relative to other phases of the product lifecycle, a necessary step toward understanding system behaviour and satisfying traceability requirements. Significant challenges remain for integrating information across the lifecycle and enabling efficient decision-making. In this paper, we explore opportunities for mapping standard data representations, such as the Standard for the Exchange of Product Data (STEP), MTConnect, and the Quality Information Framework (QIF) to integrate information silos existing across the lifecycle. To demonstrate this vision, we describe a reference implementation with a contract manufacturer in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Smart Manufacturing Systems Test Bed. Using this implementation, we explore how knowledge generated from manufacturing can support lifecycle decision-making. As a case study, we then present an interactive prototype correlating the test bed's data based on the context that must be provided for a specific decision-making viewpoint.},

@article{Ceret2013,
abstract = {CONTEXT Designers and developers are increasingly expected to deliver high quality systems, i.e. systems that are usable, robust, consistent as well as evolutionary, and that fulfill users' needs. To produce such systems, Design Methods suggest many approaches. However, the important number of existing approaches makes the choice of a method among the others particularly difficult. In addition to this, and because of the time required for understanding (and then operationalizing) new methods, designers tend to use already known methods, even though those which sometimes may not really be adapted to their needs. OBJECTIVE This paper proposes a classification of characteristics of design methods process models. In other terms, it proposes a taxonomy that aims to facilitate the discovery and the choice of methods for designers and developers. METHOD From a study of process models of several design methods, we identify six main axes, namely Cycle, Collaboration, Artifacts, Recommended Use, Maturity and Flexibility, which are in turn divided into 34 characteristics. RESULTS This paper provides a deep theorical insight. For each characteristic identified from relevant literature, a definition and a gradation, illustrated using examples, are given. Moreover, it presents a web site that offers various tools for exploring the axes of our taxonomy. This web site provides an overview of process models as well as means for comparing them, textually or graphically. Finally, the paper relates the first evaluation conducted in order to estimate designers' adhesion to the taxonomy in terms of easiness of learning, completeness and intention to use. CONCLUSION We show, based on evaluation results, that our taxonomy of process models facilitates the discovery of new methods and helps designers in choosing suitable methods, really adapted to their needs. Therefore, it enhances chances to conduct high quality projects.},

@article{Regli2016,
abstract = {We are witnessing the emergence of a new paradigm in the modeling of material structures. It stems from the digitization of manufacturing and is fueled by advances in additive manufacturing and material science. This paper strives to provide a critical examination of this new paradigm in a historical and technological context and to show that it requires non-trivial extensions and generalizations of the classical theoretical foundation and algorithmic solutions originally developed for solid modeling. Specifically, it requires new models and data-intensive representations for materials, physical behavior, and manufacturing processes across multiple scales. In particular, we argue that most computational tasks that support traditional and emerging manufacturing may be formulated systematically and addressed in terms of relations (conversions, synthesis, change propagation updates, verification, and other harmonization activities) among four views (manifestations) of an engineered artifact: Functional, which captures the design constraints and tolerances on shape, properties, and behavior; Designed, which represents a toleranced design that satisfies these constraints; Planned, which defines a manufacturing process plan; Simulated, which models the expected outcome of the process plan; and a Real sample set of physical artifacts produced by executing the process plan on a particular manufacturing technology. Based on this formulation, we outline important directions for a research agenda aimed at enabling, driving, and amplifying further advances in digital design and manufacturing.},

The SBF language captures the expressive power of the earlier programs and provides a basis for interactive construction of SBF models. We provide a precise specification of the SBF language.

abstract = {Function, structure, and behavior are the three major facets of any system. Structure and behavior are two inseparable system aspects, as no system can be faithfully modeled without considering both in tandem. Object-Process Methodology (OPM) is a systems paradigm and language that combines structure–behavior codesign requirements with cognitive considerations. Based on the formal mathematical foundations of graph grammars and a subset of natural language, OPM caters to human intuition in a bimodal way via graphics and autogenerated natural language text. In a nutshell, OPM processes transform objects by creating them, consuming them, or changing their states. The concurrent representation of structure and behavior in the same, single diagram type is balanced, creating synergy whereby each aspect helps understand the other. This chapter defines and demonstrates the principles and elements of OPM, showing its benefits in facilitating structure–behavior codesign and achieving formal, semantically sound, and humanly accessible conceptual models of complex systems in a host of domains and at virtually any complexity level.},

abstract = {Data envelopment analysis (DEA) has been proven as an excellent data-oriented performance evaluation method when multiple inputs and outputs are present in a set of peer decision-making units (DMUs). In the DEA literature, a context-dependent DEA is developed to provide finer evaluation results by examining the efficiency of DMUs in specific performance levels based upon radial DEA efficiency scores. In DEA, non-zero input and output slacks are very likely to present after the radial efficiency score improvement. Often, these non-zero slack values represent a substantial amount of inefficiency. Therefore, in order to fully measure the inefficiency in DMU's performance, it is very important to also consider the inefficiency represented by the non-zero slacks in the context-dependent DEA. This study proposes a slack-based context-dependent DEA which allows a full evaluation of inefficiency in a DMUs performance. By using slack-based efficiency measure, we obtain different frontier levels and more appropriate performance benchmarks for inefficient DMUs.},

abstract = {This research develops a MapReduce framework for automatic pattern recognition based on fault diagnosis by solving data imbalance problem in a cloud-based manufacturing (CBM). Fault diagnosis in a CBM system significantly contributes to reduce the product testing cost and enhances manufacturing quality. One of the major challenges facing the big data analytics in CBM is handling of data-sets, which are highly imbalanced in nature due to poor classification result when machine learning techniques are applied on such data-sets. The framework proposed in this research uses a hybrid approach to deal with big data-set for smarter decisions. Furthermore, we compare the performance of radial basis function-based Support Vector Machine classifier with standard techniques. Our findings suggest that the most important task in CBM is to predict the effect of data errors on quality due to highly imbalance unstructured data-set. The proposed framework is an original contribution to the body of literature, where our proposed MapReduce framework has been used for fault detection by managing data imbalance problem appropriately and relating it to firm?s profit function. The experimental results are validated using a case study of steel plate manufacturing fault diagnosis, with crucial performance matrices such as accuracy, specificity and sensitivity. A comparative study shows that the methods used in the proposed framework outperform the traditional ones.},

abstract = {The internet of things (IoT) is the latest web evolution that incorporates billions of devices (such as cameras, sensors, RFIDs, smart phones, and wearables), that are owned by different organizations and people who are deploying and using them for their own purposes. Federations of such IoT devices (we refer to as IoT things) can deliver the information needed to solve internet-scale problems that have been too difficult to obtain and harness before. To realize this unprecedented IoT potential, we need to develop IoT solutions for discovering the IoT devices each application needs, collecting and integrating their data, and distilling the high value information each application needs. We also need to provide solutions that permit doing these tasks in real-time, on the move, in the cloud, and securely. In this paper we present an overview of a collection of IoT solutions (which we have developed in partnerships with other prominent IoT innovators and refer to them collectively as IoT platform) for addressing these technical challenges and help springboard IoT to its potential. We also describe a variety of IoT applications that have utilized the proposed IoT platform to provide smart IoT services in the areas of smart farming, smart grids, and smart manufacturing. Finally, we discuss future research and a vision of the next generation IoT infrastructure.},

One approach to integration is through the annotation of multiple bodies of data using common controlled vocabularies or ‘ontologies'. Unfortunately, the very success of this approach has led to a proliferation of ontologies, which itself creates obstacles to integration. The Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO) consortium is pursuing a strategy to overcome this problem. Existing OBO ontologies, including the Gene Ontology, are undergoing coordinated reform, and new ontologies are being created on the basis of an evolving set of shared principles governing ontology development. The result is an expanding family of ontologies designed to be interoperable and logically well formed and to incorporate accurate representations of biological reality. We describe this OBO Foundry initiative and provide guidelines for those who might wish to become involved.},

abstract = {Conventional data envelopment analysis (DEA) treats the production system as a black box when measuring efficiency, ignoring its internal structure. By taking the operations of the component processes of the system into consideration, several network DEA models have been developed. Of these, the slacks-based measure (SBM) approach has attracted much attention for its ability to provide suitable efficiency measures, especially for weakly efficient production units. This paper proposes a general SBM model for network systems, and is able to decompose the system efficiency into a weighted average of the process efficiencies. This relationship holds for all types of network structure. An example shows that the network model has stronger discriminating power than the conventional black-box model, and the system efficiency is indeed a weighted average of the process efficiencies. The decomposition of the system efficiency helps identify key factors to improve the performance of a production unit.},

abstract = {Traditional Production Planning and Control systems do not successfully deal with new organisational forms of manufacturing, like production “islands”, product oriented or customer driven production. These current trends lead in practice to a strong decentralisation of production management tasks and to an “object oriented structuring” of the manufacturing process. Planning and operation in this global environment requires new skills and new approaches, namely, the co-ordination of global networks of manufacturing units and of large complex supply chains. In this paper, we present a decentralised information system designed to address the tasks of production planning that result from sales orders, originated in customers located anywhere in the world, and accomplished through a distributed manufacturing network. The system addresses the requirements of a make-to-order environment and is hopefully able to produce realistic satisfactory delivery dates. The information infrastructure designed and implemented using distributed object-oriented technology with a component based architecture has proven to be efficient and powerful, satisfying all the major tight requirements of information systems in an environment of distributed manufacturing.},

Model-Based Systems Engineering (MBSE) has proven to be effective at managing complexity through the development of systems in a virtual environment. Several languages have been developed in the spirit of MBSE; however, these languages often do not include the full spectrum of information needed for holistic system solutions. The Lifecycle Modeling Language (LML) has been developed to provide extensible language that contains both visualization models and an ontology. When LML is coupled with the Systems Modeling Language (SysML), the result is a modeling constructs that better supports systems engineering processes across the entire spectrum of lifecycle concerns. This coupling will not only be beneficial today, but could serve as a catalyst for a future MBSE environment.},

abstract = {The manufacturing industry is currently in the midst of a data-driven revolution, which promises to transform traditional manufacturing facilities in to highly optimised smart manufacturing facilities. These smart facilities are focused on creating manufacturing intelligence from real-time data to support accurate and timely decision-making that can have a positive impact across the entire organisation. To realise these efficiencies emerging technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) and Cyber Physical Systems (CPS) will be embedded in physical processes to measure and monitor real-time data from across the factory, which will ultimately give rise to unprecedented levels of data production. Therefore, manufacturing facilities must be able to manage the demands of exponential increase in data production, as well as possessing the analytical techniques needed to extract meaning from these large datasets. More specifically, organisations must be able to work with big data technologies to meet the demands of smart manufacturing. However, as big data is a relatively new phenomenon and potential applications to manufacturing activities are wide-reaching and diverse, there has been an obvious lack of secondary research undertaken in the area. Without secondary research, it is difficult for researchers to identify gaps in the field, as well as aligning their work with other researchers to develop strong research themes. In this study, we use the formal research methodology of systematic mapping to provide a breadth-first review of big data technologies in manufacturing.},

abstract = {Simulation technology has been demonstrated to be an effective tool for reducing costs, improving quality, and shortening the time to market for manufactured goods in the manufacturing industry. But, there are a number of technical and economic barriers that hinder the use of this technology in the manufacturing industry. The cost of developing, implementing, and using simulation technology is high. The costs of integrating simulation systems with other manufacturing applications are even higher. There is always a need to transfer, exchange and share data between simulation and other manufacturing applications. Developing custom-built proprietary interfaces is too costly and makes using simulation technology prohibitive for most users. The development of reusable, neutral, standard interface, would make it easier and could help reduce the costs to integrate simulation and other manufacturing applications. NIST researchers in collaboration with industrial partners have been working on a standards development effort titled Core Manufacturing Simulation Data (CMSD) Product Development Group (PDG) under the guidelines, policies and procedures of the Simulation Interoperability Standards Organization (SISO). This paper presents the purpose of the CMSD effort, provides an overview of the CMSD Information Model, and describes an approach on how the CMSD Information Model is used to support the integration of manufacturing simulations.},

abstract = {AbstractEfficiency decomposition is being able to know the most effective way to improve a company?s organisational efficiency. This study proposes a network performance evaluation model with non-controllable variables to evaluate dealers with an emphasis on their internal processes, including demand forecasting, sales force and inventory control. The proposed model decomposes the organisational efficiency into a weighted average of internal process efficiencies, where the weights associated with the internal processes are data-driven. This is applied to an empirical case consisting of 27 automobile parts dealers in Taiwan. Based on the analysis results, dealers know the relative contribution of each internal process to the organisational efficiency, and inefficient dealers are assigned targets for enhancing the organisational efficiency as well as the process efficiencies.},

abstract = {In the engineering and manufacturing domain, there is currently an atmosphere of departure to a new era of digitized production. In different regions, initiatives in these directions are known under different names, such as industrie du futur in France, industrial internet in the US or Industrie 4.0 in Germany. While the vision of digitizing production and manufacturing gained much traction lately, it is still relatively unclear how this vision can actually be implemented with concrete standards and technologies. Within the German Industry 4.0 initiative, the concept of an Administrative Shell was devised to respond to these requirements. The Administrative Shell is planned to provide a digital representation of all information being available about and from an object which can be a hardware system or a software platform. In this paper, we present an approach to develop such a digital re presentation based on semantic knowledge representation formalisms such as RDF, RDF Schema and OWL. We present our concept of a Semantic I4.0 Component which addresses the communication and comprehension challenges in Industry 4.0 scenarios using semantic technologies. Our approach is illustrated with a concrete example showing its benefits in a real-world use case.},

abstract = {With the increasing complexity of engineering systems, ensuring high system reliability and system performance robustness throughout a product life cycle is of vital importance in practical engineering design. Dynamic reliability analysis, which is generally encountered due to time-variant system random inputs, becomes a primary challenge in reliability-based robust design optimization (RBRDO). This article presents a new approach to efficiently carry out dynamic reliability analysis for RBRDO. The key idea of the proposed approach is to convert time-variant probabilistic constraints to time-invariant ones by efficiently constructing a nested extreme response surface (NERS) and then carry out dynamic reliability analysis using NERS in an iterative RBRDO process. The NERS employs an efficient global optimization technique to identify the extreme time responses that correspond to the worst case scenario of system time-variant limit state functions. With these extreme time samples, a kriging-based time prediction model is built and used to estimate extreme responses for any given arbitrary design in the design space. An adaptive response prediction and model maturation mechanism is developed to guarantee the accuracy and efficiency of the proposed NERS approach. The NERS is integrated with RBRDO with time-variant probabilistic constraints to achieve optimum designs of engineered systems with desired reliability and performance robustness. Two case studies are used to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Advanced, highly specialized economies require instant, robust and efficient information flows within its value-added and Supply Chain networks. Especially also in the context of the recent Industry 4.0, smart manufacturing or cyber-physical systems initiatives more efficient and effective information exchange in supply networks is of paramount importance. The Supply Chain Operation Reference (SCOR) is a cross-industry approach to lay the groundwork for this goal by defining a conceptual model for Supply Chain related information. Semantics-based approaches could facilitate information flows in supply networks, and enable to analyze, monitor and optimize Supply Chains (in particular for robustness). This paper first reviews existing formalizations of the Supply Chain Council's SCOR standard. It then introduces the SCORVoc RDFS vocabulary which fully formalizes the latest SCOR standard, while over-coming the identified limitations of existing work. SCORVoc is operationalized by a set of SPARQL queries, that enable to evaluate metrics and key performance indicator (KPIs) defined by SCOR, on-the-fly, in an information systems that adheres to the vocabulary. Finally, we define concrete test scenarios and implement a synthetic benchmark to demonstrate the practicality of SCORVoc.},

abstract = {In the engineering design community, decision making methodologies to select the "best" design from among feasible designs is one of the most critical part of the design process. As the design models become increasingly realistic, the decision making methodology becomes increasingly complex. That is, because of the realistic design models, more and more decisions are made under uncertain environments without making any unrealistic assumptions. A decision maker is usually forced to work with uncertainties of which some stochastic information is known (aleatory) or no information is known (epistemic). In this paper, we discuss both forms of uncertainties and their modeling methodologies. We also define risk as a random function of these uncertainties and propose a risk quantification technique. Existing methods to handle aleatory uncertainties are discussed and an alternative search based decision making methodology is proposed to handle epistemic uncertainties. We illustrate our decision making methodology using the side-impact crashworthiness problem presented by Gu, et.al. [1]. In addition to the aleatory uncertainties considered by these researchers, we model a couple of non-design variables as epistemic uncertainties in our decision problem. Lack of information of these epistemic uncertainties increases the complexity of the side-impact crashworthiness problem significantly. However, the proposed methodology helps to identify a robust design with respect to epistemic uncertainty. Copyright 2009 by ASME.},

abstract = {Function, structure, and behavior are the three major facets of any system. Structure and behavior are two inseparable system aspects, as no system can be faithfully modeled without considering both in tandem. Object-Process Methodology (OPM) is a systems paradigm and language that combines structure–behavior codesign requirements with cognitive considerations. Based on the formal mathematical foundations of graph grammars and a subset of natural language, OPM caters to human intuition in a bimodal way via graphics and autogenerated natural language text. In a nutshell, OPM processes transform objects by creating them, consuming them, or changing their states. The concurrent representation of structure and behavior in the same, single diagram type is balanced, creating synergy whereby each aspect helps understand the other. This chapter defines and demonstrates the principles and elements of OPM, showing its benefits in facilitating structure–behavior codesign and achieving formal, semantically sound, and humanly accessible conceptual models of complex systems in a host of domains and at virtually any complexity level.},

abstract = {Event-driven distributed systems have two important characteristics, which differentiate them from other system types: the existence of several software or hardware components that run simultaneously on different inter-networked nodes, and the use of events as the main vehicle to organize component intercommunication. Clearly, both attributes influence event-driven distributed architectures, which are discussed in this chapter. We start with presenting the event-driven software architecture, which describes various logical components and their roles in events generation, transmission, processing, and consumption. This is used in early phases of distributed event-driven systems' development as a blueprint for the whole development process including concept, design, implementation, testing, and maintenance. It also grounds important architectural concepts and highlights the challenges faced by event-driven distributed system developers. The core part of the chapter presents several system architectures, which capture the physical realization of event-driven distributed systems, more specifically the ways logical components are instantiated and placed on real machines. Important characteristics such as performance, efficient use of resources, fault tolerance, security, and others are strongly determined by the adopted system architecture and the technologies behind it. The most important research results are organized along five themes: complex event processing, Event-Driven Service Oriented Architecture (ED-SOA), Grid architecture, Peer-to-Peer (P2P) architecture, and Agent architecture. For each topic, we present previous work, describe the most recent achievements, highlight their advantages and limitations, and indicate future research trends in event-driven distributed system architectures.},

abstract = {Control Theory is at the heart of information and communication technologies of complex systems. It can contribute to meeting the energy and environmental challenges we are facing. The textbook is organized in the way an engineer classically proceeds to solve a control problem, that is, elaboration of a mathematical model capturing the process behavior, analysis of this model and design of a control to achieve the desired objectives. It is divided into three Parts. The first part of the text addresses modeling aspects through state space and input-output representations. The notion of the internal state of a system (for example mechanical, thermal or electrical), as well as its description using a finite number of variables, is also emphasized. The second part is devoted to the stability analysis of an equilibrium point. The authors present classical tools for stability analysis, such as linearization techniques and Lyapunov functions. Central to Control Theory are the notions of feedback and of closed-loop, and the third part of the textbook describes the linear control synthesis in a continuous and discrete-time framework and also in a probabilistic context. Quadratic optimization and Kalman filtering are presented, as well as the polynomial representation, a convenient approach to reject perturbations on the system without making the control law more complex.

abstract = {This paper describes the task/episode accumulation model (TEA model) of non-routine mechanical design, which was developed after detailed analysis of the audio and video protocols of five mechanical designers. The model is able to explain the behavior of designers at a much finer level of detail than previous models. The key features of the model are (a) the design is constructed by incrementally refining and patching an initial conceptual design, (b) design alternatives are not considered outside the boundaries of design episodes (which are short stretches of problem solving aimed at specific goals), (c) the design process is controlled locally, primarily at the level of individual episodes. Among the implications of the model are the following: (a) CAD tools should be extended to represent the state of the design at more abstract levels, (b) CAD tools should help the designer manage constraints, and (c) CAD tools should be designed to give cognitive support to the designer.},

abstract = {One important aspect of product lifecycle management (PLM) is the computer-sensible representation of product information. Over the past 15 years or so, several languages and technologies have emerged that vary in their emphasis and applicability for such usage. ISO 10303, informally known as the Standard for the Exchange of Product Model Data (STEP), contains the high-quality product information models needed for electronic business solutions. By using STEP, the aerospace, automotive, and shipbuilding industries are saving {\$}150M/yr primarily in areas related to geometric modeling. However, traditional STEP-based model information is represented using languages that are unfamiliar to most application developers, thus impeding widespread usage in other areas. This paper discusses efforts underway to make STEP information models available via mechanisms familiar to more business application developers, specifically XML and the Unified Modeling Language™ (UML{\textregistered} ). We also present a vision and roadmap for STEP integration with XML, UML, and other technologies to enable enhanced PLM interoperability. Our conclusion is that STEP, XML, and UML are complementary technologies, where STEP provides significant standardized content models, while XML and UML provide enhanced implementation methods. Together, they are a powerful force to enable pervasive digital representation and sharing of diverse technical information.},

abstract = {In this paper, we will propose a slacks-based measure (SBM) of efficiency in Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA). This scalar measure deals directly with the input excesses and the output shortfalls of the decision making unit (DMU) concerned. It is units invariant and monotone decreasing with respect to input excess and output shortfall. Furthermore, this measure is determined only by consulting the reference-set of the DMU and is not affected by statistics over the whole data set. The new measure has a close connection with other measures proposed so far, e.g., Charnes–Cooper–Rhodes (CCR), Banker–Charnes–Cooper (BCC) and the Russell measure of efficiency. The dual side of this model can be interpreted as profit maximization, in contrast to the ratio maximization of the CCR model. Numerical experiments show its validity as an efficiency measurement tool and its compatibility with other measures of efficiency.},

abstract = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is the main driver for industrial smart products produced by an increasing number of manufacturers. The overall functionality of smart products is a combination of mechanical, electrical/electronic functions (hardware functions) and software functions. For hardware and software there are different lifecycle models: Product lifecycle management (PLM) focuses on hardware, application lifecycle management (ALM) focuses on software. Smart products force manufacturers to converge both lifecycle models step by step. Although seemingly important, the research community leaves this innovative area mostly up to the PLM tool vendors and the ALM tool vendors, resulting in them driving the convergence. This paper points out the mismatch between industry and academia regarding the PLM/ALM convergence. We encourage academia to increase research activities and we propose potential research topics.},

abstract = {Rapid changes in technology have led to an increasingly fast pace of product introductions. For long-life systems (e.g., planes, ships, and nuclear power plants), rapid changes help sustain useful life, but at the same time, present significant challenges associated with obsolescence management. Over the years, many approaches for forecasting obsolescence risk and product life cycle have been developed. However, gathering inputs required for forecasting is often subjective and laborious, causing inconsistencies in predictions. To address these issues, the objective of this research is to develop a machine learning-based methodology capable of forecasting obsolescence risk and product life cycle accurately while minimizing maintenance and upkeep of the forecasting system. Specifically, this new methodology enables prediction of both the obsolescence risk level and the date when a part becomes obsolete. A case study of the cell phone market is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the new approach. Results have shown that machine learning algorithms (i.e., random forest, artificial neural networks, and support vector machines) can classify parts as active or obsolete with over 98{\%} accuracy and predict obsolescence dates within a few months.},

An integrated process, called TRAC, for managing technology development along this pathway, consists of 4 elements: 1. a technology review process, 2. a technology development team, 3. a Senior Review Committee, and 4. a structure methodology.

abstract = {This paper presents a method for assessing the quality of progressive design processes that seek to maximize the profitability of the product that is being designed. The proposed approach uses separations, a type of problem decomposition, to model progressive design processes. The subproblems in the separations correspond roughly to phases in the progressive design processes. We simulate the choices of a bounded rational designer for each subproblem using different search algorithms. We consider different types and versions of these search processes in order to determine if the results are robust to the decision-making model. We use a simple two-variable problem to help describe the approach and then apply the approach to assess motor design processes. Methods for assessing the quality of engineering design processes can be used to guide improvements to engineering design processes and generate more valuable products. Copyright by ASME.},

abstract = {In this paper, we propose the new framework of Kansei Engineering System (KES), called Hybrid KES, which can support both consumer and designer as the decision support system (DSS). Kansei Engineering is defined as “translating technology of a consumer's feeling and image for a product into design elements” (Nagamachi, 1989). It is the Kansei Engineering System which we developed to utilize on the product development process using Kansei Engineering techniques. There are two types of KES, one for the consumers decision supporting system called the Forward Kansei Engineering System, and another for the designer supporting system called the Backward Kansei Engineering System. The combined computerized system of the Forward KES and Backward KES must be powerful supporting tools for both users. This paper introduces the structure of the combined system, and proposes the Hybrid KES as the new general framework of Kansei Engineering System. Relevance to industry Hybrid KES consists of Forward KES and Backward KES. The former is the KES in which a designer obtains the demanded design through an input of the Kansei word. In the Backward KES, the designer is able to draw a rough sketch in the computer and the computer system recognizes the pattern of the design inputted by the designer. The combined computerized system of the Forward KES and Backward KES must be powerful supporting tools for both consumer and designer.},

abstract = {The effectiveness of conservation efforts ultimately depends on the recognition that decision making, and the systems that it is designed to affect, are inherently dynamic and characterized by multiple sources of uncertainty. To cope with these challenges, conservation planners are increasingly turning to the tools of decision analysis, especially dynamic optimization methods. Here we provide a general framework for optimal, dynamic conservation and then explore its capacity for coping with various sources and degrees of uncertainty. In broadest terms, the dynamic optimization problem in conservation is choosing among a set of decision options at periodic intervals so as to maximize some conservation objective over the planning horizon. Planners must account for immediate objective returns, as well as the effect of current decisions on future resource conditions and, thus, on future decisions. Undermining the effectiveness of such a planning process are uncertainties concerning extant resource conditions (partial observability), the immediate consequences of decision choices (partial controllability), the outcomes of uncontrolled, environmental drivers (environmental variation), and the processes structuring resource dynamics (structural uncertainty). Where outcomes from these sources of uncertainty can be described in terms of probability distributions, a focus on maximizing the expected objective return, while taking state-specific actions, is an effective mechanism for coping with uncertainty. When such probability distributions are unavailable or deemed unreliable, a focus on maximizing robustness is likely to be the preferred approach. Here the idea is to choose an action (or state-dependent policy) that achieves at least some minimum level of performance regardless of the (uncertain) outcomes. We provide some examples of how the dynamic optimization problem can be framed for problems involving management of habitat for an imperiled species, conservation of a critically endangered population through captive breeding, control of invasive species, construction of biodiversity reserves, design of landscapes to increase habitat connectivity, and resource exploitation. Although these decision making problems and their solutions present significant challenges, we suggest that a systematic and effective approach to dynamic decision making in conservation need not be an onerous undertaking. The requirements are shared with any systematic approach to decision making - a careful consideration of values, actions, and outcomes. 2013 IOP Publishing Ltd.},

@article{Drucker1991,
abstract = {One hundred years ago, Frederick Taylor set off a revolution that ultimately defeated Marx. By studying how the work of making and moving things could be performed most effectively, Taylor laid the foundation for gains in manufacturing productivity that allowed common laborers to earn the wages of skilled craftsmen. Today the developed economies need another productivity revolution--this time in knowledge and service work. The country that first achieves such productivity gains will dominate the next century economically. Countries that fail--particularly with respect to service workers--will face rising social tensions, if not class war. The key to this new productivity revolution is what Taylor called "working smarter." Applied to knowledge and service work, working smarter requires five distinct steps: • Define the task. Ask about each job not only "What are we trying to accomplish?" but also "Must we do it at all?" The easiest productivity gains come from eliminating what does not need to be done. • Concentrate on the task. Too much "job enrichment" takes the form of busywork, diverting employees from work that adds value. • Define performance. For some jobs, performance means quality. For a second set of jobs, quality and quantity constitute performance. Finally, some service jobs are "production" jobs, in which performance is largely defined by the quantity of work accomplished, and quality is a matter of external criteria. • Ask the people who do the work how they think their productivity can be improved. Today's managers have to work in partnership with employees. • Build continuous learning into the organization through training and by asking the best performers to become teachers for the rest.

abstract = {The primary objective of the design for supply chain (DFSC) is the selection of an appropriate product family. Moreover, it deals with the selection of the optimal combination among the different conflicting criteria while making a trade-off between the supply chain cost, sales profit and the product design complexities. In this research, to address the DFSC issues a product platform approach has been proposed which amalgamates the component modularity as well as the function modularity in the product design. The optimisation model proposed in this paper for the product development and the supply chain design is based on a generic bill of materials (GBOM) representation. The complete framework includes vital decision-making needed for designing a robust supply chain such as locating plants to alleviate the likely dominance of production cost and market mediation cost on product variety and imparting process flexibility of the located plants. The optimisation model proposed in this paper, models the supply chain cost, sales profit and product design complexity as three criteria that altogether determine the robustness of the supply chain and the underlying product development approach. Certain parameters like process flexibility, flow types and drivers of the product variety dominance have been controlled in the design framework. To resolve the complexity of the proposed model a genetic algorithm (GA) technique has been proposed. The proposed GA adopts an arithmetic crossover, a dynamic mutation and a variable penalty strategy to produce optimal results in a very short computational time. To validate the proposed model, a simulated case study of the wiring harness supplier of an AGV manufacturer has been studied. 2011 Taylor Francis.},

@phdthesis{Fang2016,
abstract = {The objective of a manufacturing firm is to design and make products satisfying customers' needs and desires. The ability of bringing new products to the market is vital to the competitiveness of manufacturing firms. The concepts of design for manufacturing, robust design, and concurrent engineering have attracted a great amount of attention in research and industry because they are aimed to improve product development time and cost. Thus, these concepts are considered by the research community of having the ability to increase the capabilities of manufacturing firms. However, recent business literature has indicated that manufacturing firms are facing a tremendous challenge meeting product delivery deadlines. Scholars and practitioners agreed that one major cause of this challenge is due to insufficient producibility of new products. Scholars and practitioners recommend that integrating manufacturing process capability data into the design process is a crucial way to improve design producibility. Through the analysis results based on collected data, this research confirmed the following literature recommendations: manufacturing data contains critical information applicable to design. However, manufacturing data is not well-structured and user-friendly to designers. Therefore, the design community can not readily use the manufacturing data. The goal of this research is to increase design producibility through the development and validation of a methodology also named as a new design tool. The proposed methodology also named as new design tool has the ability to re-structure manufacturing process capability data through the introduction of seven data attributes. Due to the complexity of manufacturing systems, scholars have identified that even well-structured data is not useful to designers. Therefore, the second functionality of the proposed methodology is translation of data into meaningful information that is useful to designers. The concepts of Capability Map and Capability Map Bank have been introduced in converting data into meaningful information. The third functionality of the proposed methodology also named as new design tool is the capability of early estimation of design producibility during early design phases. The early estimation capability is accomplished by the introduction of two new variables known as Desired Capability Index and Critical Point, and Performance Line which is a graphical tool. Two major streams of contributions have been made by this research. First, the stream of contribution that impacts the research community is: • introduction of quantitative measurement of manufacturability rating using Desired Capability Index and Critical Point • the analysis and recommendations based on extensive data collected from industry The second stream of contributions of this research that expected to impact the industry is • descriptions of the critical functions required to integrate manufacturing data into design process • recommendations on implementation strategy of a new design tool in manufacturing firms In summary, this research developed a methodology also named as new design tool through the voices of practitioners from the manufacturing firms and recommendations from literature. The validation study revealed that the new design tool is on the right track to satisfy industrial needs. This research data and the proposed methodology establish a fundamental baseline to inspire future work in the research and industrial communities.},

abstract = {There has been a burgeoning literature about exploitation and exploration since March's seminal article in 1991. However, in reviewing the extant literature we find different interpretations of both concepts leading to ambiguity and even some inconsistency. This paper focuses in particular on the interpretation of exploration and exploitation in the literature on technological innovation. It addresses two critical research questions. First, what are the different interpretations of exploitation and exploration? Second, how can we set up a framework that reconciles these differences and reduces the ambiguity that we find in the literature? To answer these two questions, we first explain what the root causes of these different viewpoints are. Second, we provide a theoretical framework that integrates the different perspectives, sets up a new typology to define exploration and exploitation, identifies white spaces in the current research and provides guidance for future research.},

A number of research works and commercial systems have appeared to provide solutions for collaborative and distributed product development, and the practical applications are getting more pervasive and mature. In this paper, the recently related works are summarised from three aspects?visualisation-based collaborative systems, co-design collaborative systems and CE (concurrent engineering)-based collaborative systems. Around these aspects, about 100 papers and 30 commercial systems/international standards published or launched recently are discussed. The current research and development statuses and issues, underlying algorithms, mechanisms and system architectures, and the future trends and challenges are explained and compared in detail.},

This can cause worse function, shorter life or failure of a civil engineering structure, a machine, vehicle or another appliance. The paper shows main causes of the uncertainties and deviations and presents a systematic approach and efficient tools for their elimination or mitigation of consequences. Emphasis is put on the design stage, which is most important for reliability ensuring. Principles of robust design and important tools are explained, including FMEA, sensitivity analysis and probabilistic simulation methods. The lifetime prediction of long-life objects can be improved by long-term monitoring of the load response and damage accumulation in operation. The condition evaluation of engineering structures, such as bridges, is often based on visual inspection and verbal description. Here, methods based on fuzzy logic can reduce the subjective influences.},

Modularity is a general concept, and many engineering problems can be generalised under the umbrella of modularity. Numerous studies have been carried out on modularity-relevant issues; however, systematic classification has not been discussed for modularity in terms of its applications and methodologies for developing modularity in systems. This paper presents a taxonomy on modularity applications, research issues, and design methodologies. It provides a general framework for further systematic development of modularity in systems. General solutions to identified problems which should be studied in future are also discussed.},

abstract = {Projects, as the common unit of organizing complex tasks, often feature unique challenges that require both radical innovation and incremental improvements to processes and solutions in order to deliver the project within constraints. Both exploration and exploitation are likely to be needed for complex engineering projects to succeed. This study, through an in-depth case study of a complex infrastructure project facing unique challenges and tight budget and schedule, investigates the antecedents of ambidexterity and the effect of ambidexterity on project performance. The main contributions of this research include finding: (1) ambidexterity at the project team level to be a significant contributor to project performance; (2) the effects of temporal separation and project context on project performance are mediated by the project team's degree of ambidexterity; and (3) contrary to the prediction from organizational literature, structural separation has not contributed to the case project team's ambidexterity. The authors believe that among the three antecedents for ambidexterity at the project level as predicted by organizational literature, structural separation is rendered ineffective by the natural cycling between exploration and exploitation in the project environment and by the need to integrate the two under time pressure and resource constraints. The development of an effective project context can facilitate the temporal cycling between exploration and exploitation by creating awareness that overcomes the inertia in transitioning between the two by setting performance expectations and appropriate social context. Implications for theory development and practice are discussed.},

@article{Kheddouci2010,
abstract = {  The use of engineering drawings in the development of mechanical products, including the exchange of engineering data as well as for archiving, is common industry practice. Traditionally, paper has been the mean to deliver those needs. However, these practices have evolved in favour of computerized tools and methods for the creation, diffusion and preservation of data involved in the process of developing aeronautical products characterized by life cycles that can exceed 70 years. Therefore, it is necessary to redefine how to maintain this data in a context whereby engineering drawings are being replaced by the 3D annotated digital mock-up. This thesis addresses the issue of long-term archiving of 3D annotated digital mock-ups, which includes geometric and dimensional tolerances, as well as other notes and specifications, in compliance with the requirements formulated by the aviation industry including regulatory and legal requirements. First, we review the requirements imposed by the aviation industry in the context of long-term archiving of 3D annotated digital mock-ups. We then consider alternative solutions. We begin by identifying the theoretical approach behind the choice of a conceptual model for digital long-term archiving. Then we evaluate, among the proposed alternatives, an archiving format that will guarantee the preservation of the integrity of the 3D annotated model (geometry, tolerances and other metadata) and its sustainability. The evaluation of 3D PDF PRC as a potential archiving format is carried out on a sample of 185 3D CATIA V5 models (parts and assemblies) provided by industrial partners. This evaluation is guided by a set of criteria including the transfer of geometry, 3D annotations, views, captures and parts positioning in assembly. The results indicate that maintaining the exact geometry is done successfully when transferring CATIA V5 models to 3D PDF PRC. Concerning the transfer of 3D annotations, we observed degradation associated with their display on the 3D model. This problem can, however, be solved by performing the conversion of the native model to STEP first, and then to 3D PDF PRC. In view of current tools, PDF 3D PRC is considered as a potential solution for long-term archiving of 3D annotated models for individual parts. However, this solution is currently not deemed adequate for archiving assemblies. The practice of 2D drawing will thus remain, in the short term, for assemblies.},

abstract = {Complex organizations are conceptualized in terms of their technologies, or the work done on raw materials. Two aspects of technology vary independently: the number of exceptions that must be handled, and the degree to which search is an analyzable or unanalyzable procedure. If there is a large number of exceptions and search is not logical and analytic, the technology is described as nonroutine. Few exceptions and analyzable search procedures describe a routine technology. Two other types result from other combinations--craft and engineering technologies. Task structures vary with the technology utilized, and are analyzed in terms of control and coordination and three levels of management. Social structure in turn is related to technology and task structure. Finally, the variations in three types of goals are weakly related to the preceding variables in this conceptualization. The perspective provides a basis for comparing organizations which avoids many problems found in other schemes utilizing structure, function or goals as the basis for comparison. Furthermore, it allows one to selectively utilize competing organizational theories once it is understood that their relevance is restricted to organizations with specific kinds of technologies. The scheme makes apparent some errors in present efforts to compare organizations.},

abstract = {This paper describes a design exercise that was conducted to investigate what, if any, correlation exists between the functional complexity of a given artifact and its associated physical complexity as defined by design for manufacturing principles. Nine electromechanical consumer products were chosen and evaluated based on function and form. The results of the experiment show that the products demonstrate a significant variability in physical complexity according to design for manufacturing principles for similar if not identical functional complexity. These results demonstrate that function alone is not an adequate way to evaluate the difficulty of realizing a given concept. Performance characteristics of the functional concept must also be considered. The paper concludes with suggestions for future work in order to better understand how performance influences the physical complexity of an artifact. Copyright 2012 by ASME.},

abstract = {Requirements traceability is intended to ensure continued alignment between stakeholder requirements and various outputs of the system development process. To be useful, traces must be organized according to some modeling framework. Indeed, several such frameworks have been proposed, mostly based on theoretical considerations or analysis of other literature. This paper, in contrast, follows an empirical approach. Focus groups and interviews conducted in 26 major software development organizations demonstrate a wide range of traceability practices with distinct low-end and high-end users of traceability. From these observations, reference models comprising the most important kinds of traceability links for various development tasks have been synthesized. The resulting models have been validated in case studies and are incorporated in a number of traceability tools. A detailed case study on the use of the models is presented. Four kinds of traceability link types are identified and critical issues that must be resolved for implementing each type and potential solutions are discussed. Implications for the design of next-generation traceability methods and tools are discussed and illustrated},

To ensure optimal project management as well as to avoid risks of inconsistencies between engineering models created by engineers from different disciplines, support is needed for integrating and subsequently analyzing diverse engineering data. AutomationML is an emerging data exchange format for engineering data which makes the first step towards the easier exchange of engineering data. Yet, there is a lack of tool support for integrating, making sense of and analyzing AML files. In this paper, we explore the use of Semantic Web and Linked Data technologies to provide extended functionality on top of AML that allows advanced data analytics on engineering data such as intuitive browsing of interlinked engineering models and queries for project-wide verification and validation activities. As a result of these investigations, we present the AutomationML Analyzer prototypical implementation to showcase some of the functionalities made possible by Semantic Web and Linked Data technologies in this context.},

We begin by describing the concept, available definitions and consider its evolution where recent production technology developments (such as additive and continuous production process technologies), digitisation together with infrastructural developments (in terms of IoT and big data) provide new opportunities. To further explore the evolving nature of DM, the authors, each of whom are involved in specific applications of DM research, examine through an expert panel workshop environment emerging DM applications involving new production and supporting infrastructural technologies. This paper presents these generalisable findings on DM challenges and opportunities in terms of products, enabling production technologies and the impact on the wider production and industrial system. Industry structure and location of activities are examined in terms of the democratising impact on participating network actors. The paper concludes with a discussion on the changing nature of manufacturing as a result of DM, from the traditional centralised, large-scale, long lead-time forecast-driven production operations to a new DM paradigm where manufacturing is a decentralised, autonomous near end user-driven activity. A forward research agenda is proposed that considers the impact of DM on the industrial and urban landscape.},

abstract = {Finding a D-optimal design for a split-plot experiment requires knowledge of the relative size of the whole plot (WP) and sub-plot error variances. Since this information is typically not known a priori, we propose an optimization strategy based on balancing performance across a range of plausible variance ratios. This approach provides protection against selecting a design which could be sub-optimal if a single initial guess is incorrect. In addition, options for incorporating experimental cost into design selection are explored. The method uses Pareto front multiple criteria optimization to balance these objectives and allows the experimenter to understand the trade-offs between several design choices and select one that best suits the goals of the experiment. We present new algorithms for populating the Pareto front for the split-plot situation when the number of WPs is either fixed or flexible. We illustrate the method with a case study and demonstrate how considering robustness across variance ratios offers improved performance. The Pareto approach identifies multiple promising designs, and allows the experimenter to understand trade-offs between alternatives and examining their robustness to different ways of combining the objectives. New graphical summaries for up to four criteria are developed to help guide improved decision-making. Copyright 2012 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {The problem of aircraft sizing during conceptual design is characterized by limited knowledge and high uncertainty. Uncertainty is especially prevalent in the earlyphase estimates of design characteristics from the aerodynamics, propulsion, and weights discipline areas. In order to develop effective conceptual designs that are robust and fare well in later program phases, trade space exploration and optimization should favor design choices that are both "balanced" in terms of the multiple performance objectives and resistant to system-level losses due to missed targets for disciplinary metrics. This paper presents a study of the effects of uncertainty in multi-objective optimization in aircraft conceptual design by demonstrating the changes in the Pareto frontiers due to variability in disciplinary metrics and differences in the formulation of the probabilistic optimization problem. By analyzing these frontiers, the decision maker can judge the tradeoff between expected performance and resistance to uncertainty and can identify regions of the design space where this tradeoff is either favorable or high risk, resulting in improved decision making. To enable this analysis, multi-objective optimization and visualization techniques are tailored to the problem by incorporating Monte Carlo methods and other mechanisms of quantitatively capturing the effects of uncertainty.

abstract = {Design and verification of factory layout and material flow is a multidisciplinary, knowledge-intensive task which requires a collaborative framework where all specialists involved can communicate, interact, manage and visualize different models. However, the communication of digital models comes with challenges. The information resides in various systems and applications, in different formats and with various levels of detail and viewpoints. This makes the communication and sharing of information among different actors and application, challenging. To deal with the data exchange and integration problem, the information standards ISO 10303 (STEP) has shown a strong capability to represent rich information models in a wide variety of industrial domains for the purpose of exchanging data. On the other hand, the Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) initiative provides a minimalistic set of standardized information models, focusing on the most common concepts within a particular domain. Assuming a loosely-coupled distributed architecture of tools and services, OSLC adopts the Linked Data (LD) approach to ensure data consistency across the data resources. How can we combine STEP's rich information model for data exchange, with OSLC's minimalistic approach for data integration The aim of this work is to show the applicability of using these two complementary paradigms – and their corresponding standards to support interoperability and data integration in a heterogeneous IT environment for material flow analysis and layout design.},

Among different electricity generation options available for a microgrid, the one compromising both technical and economical aspects is of a great desire. Taking into account the existing uncertainties associated with energy resources, this paper evaluates various distributed generation (DG) configuration plans for a microgrid using analytical hierarchical process (AHP) approach. A variety of DG resources including photovoltaic and wind generation are incorporated in the analysis. Meanwhile, the uncertainties associated with solar radiation, wind speed, and fuel prices are considered. For the sake of numerical analysis, DG configuration plans are generated with the HOMER software; thereafter, the plans are assessed with the Expert Choice software that supports the AHP approach.},

abstract = {Research on when and how to use three-dimensional (3D) perspective views on flat screens for operational tasks such as air traffic control is complex. We propose a functional distinction between tasks: those that require shape understanding versus those that require precise judgments of relative position. The distortions inherent in 3D displays hamper judging relative positions, whereas the integration of dimensions in 3D displays facilitates shape understanding. We confirmed these hypotheses with two initial experiments involving simple block shapes. The shape-understanding tasks were identification or mental rotation. The relative-position tasks were locating shadows and determining directions and distances between objects. We then extended the results to four experiments involving complex natural terrain. We compare our distinction with the integral/separable task distinction of Haskel and Wickens (1993). Applications for this research include displays for air traffic control, geoplots for military command and control, and potentially, any display of 3D information.},

abstract = {ABSTRACTPrompted by difficulties inherent to causal analysis in problem formulation, and by a need for more formal and robust strategy and transformation design tools and frameworks, this article introduces a procedure for modeling strategic problems in the Systems Modeling Language (SysML). As a test bed for the procedure, we used the widely available Robin Hood strategic management case study. The modeling process fostered an enhanced understanding of the nature of the problem, and the resulting model proved rich and complex. The difficulties stemming from causal analysis were absent altogether, thus showing that SysML provides a good basis upon which to build a non-causal, systemic strategy and transformation design framework.},

abstract = {We are witnessing the emergence of a new paradigm in the modeling of material structures. It stems from the digitization of manufacturing and is fueled by advances in additive manufacturing and material science. This paper strives to provide a critical examination of this new paradigm in a historical and technological context and to show that it requires non-trivial extensions and generalizations of the classical theoretical foundation and algorithmic solutions originally developed for solid modeling. Specifically, it requires new models and data-intensive representations for materials, physical behavior, and manufacturing processes across multiple scales. In particular, we argue that most computational tasks that support traditional and emerging manufacturing may be formulated systematically and addressed in terms of relations (conversions, synthesis, change propagation updates, verification, and other harmonization activities) among four views (manifestations) of an engineered artifact: Functional, which captures the design constraints and tolerances on shape, properties, and behavior; Designed, which represents a toleranced design that satisfies these constraints; Planned, which defines a manufacturing process plan; Simulated, which models the expected outcome of the process plan; and a Real sample set of physical artifacts produced by executing the process plan on a particular manufacturing technology. Based on this formulation, we outline important directions for a research agenda aimed at enabling, driving, and amplifying further advances in digital design and manufacturing.},

abstract = {Multiple Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM) based Multi-objective Evolutionary Algorithms (MOEAs) are increasingly becoming popular for dealing with optimization problems with more than three objectives, commonly termed as many-objective optimization problems (MaOPs). These algorithms elicit preferences from a single or multiple Decision Makers (DMs), a priori or interactively, to guide the search towards the solutions most preferred by the DM(s), as against the whole Pareto-optimal Front (POF). Despite its promise for dealing with MaOPs, the utility of this approach is impaired by the lack of—objectivity; repeatability; consistency; and coherence in DM׳s preferences. This paper proposes a machine learning based framework to counter the above limitations. Towards it, the preference-structure of the different objectives embedded in the problem model is learnt in terms of: a smallest set of conflicting objectives which can generate the same POF as the original problem; the smallest objective sets corresponding to pre-specified errors; and the objective sets of pre-specified sizes that correspond to minimum error. While the focus is on demonstrating how the proposed framework could serve as a decision support for the DM, its performance is also studied vis-{\`{a}}-vis an alternative approach (based on dominance relation preservation), for a wide range of test problems and a real-world problem. The results mark a new direction for MCDM based MOEAs for MaOPs.},

abstract = {The use of data mining within manufacturing is a relatively modern application. Data mining can be used to find underlying links between the machining conditions, and parameters, and the final form of the part. Part of this procedure includes defining the form of the part, known as the manufacturing signature, which stems from all steps in the manufacturing process. In this paper, two potential definitions for the manufacturing signature of cylindrical objects are generated in terms of an analytical basis. The first description uses a simple Fourier description (known as lobing) and the second consists of a fully orthonormal description in terms of Forsythe polynomials and Fourier coefficients. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is also partially used to investigate the underlying structure of the cylinders and investigate the connection between the analytical description and PCA. Experiments were carried out, machining thirty components under different manufacturing conditions (such as coolant pressure, tool length etc.). Data mining was then carried out on the process parameters, and either the amount of a given type of lobing or the classification of the cylinder in terms of the maximal lobing. The input to data mining for our case is either a numeric answer or a classification, which motivates the use of a simplified description. The use of PCA on this data set indicates a fundamental issue stemming from subsets of “similar” data which means dimensionality reduction is not possible in the usual way. The use of the analytical basis suggests a new sampling strategy to be used on certain geometries utilising Gauss-Legendre quadrature.},

Because of the spectrum of parts and processes involved, the elaboration of these activities and flows is at a fairly high level of abstraction, using IDEF0 as the formal modelling language.  The purpose of this report is to provide the basis for a reference architecture, describing the functions and relationships of software systems in the product realization process, and the nature of the information interfaces needed among those systems. It is intended that the continuation of the work will produce a report defining the systems architecture (Part 2) and many separate reports defining particular information interfaces in detail. The goal of the work is to have some standard form of those interfaces specified and implemented by commercial manufacturing software products, so that such products will work together off-the-shelf, and thus the delivery of enhanced software capabilities to the manufacturing user may be significantly accelerated.},

abstract = {In an attempt to improve the design of products and reduce design changes, cost, and time to market, concurrent engineering or life cycle engineering has emerged as an effective approach to addressing these issues in today's competitive global market. As over 70{\%} of the total life cycle cost of a product is committed at the early design stage, designers are in a position to substantially reduce the life cycle cost of the products they design, by giving due consideration to life cycle cost implications of their design decisions. Increasing recognition of cost competition has spurred the development of methodologies such as design for manufacturability, design for assembly (DFA), design for producibility, design for maintainability and design for quality, in the design for 'X' realm. Although these methodologies have for the most part proven successful in reducing cost, the design evaluation criterion in most of these methodologies is not cost. Therefore methodologies and tools are needed to directly provide cost information to designers. Life Cycle Cost (LCC) analysis provides a framework for specifying the estimated total incremental cost of developing, producing, using, and retiring a particular item. This paper looks at the issues of LCC analysis and the tools that have been developed to provide engineers with cost information to guide them in design.},

This model creates a brand new opportunity for enterprises. In this paper, some of the essential features of cloud computing are briefly discussed with regard to the end-users, enterprises that use the cloud as a platform, and cloud providers themselves. Cloud computing is emerging as one of the major enablers for the manufacturing industry; it can transform the traditional manufacturing business model, help it to align product innovation with business strategy, and create intelligent factory networks that encourage effective collaboration. Two types of cloud computing adoptions in the manufacturing sector have been suggested, manufacturing with direct adoption of cloud computing technologies and cloud manufacturing—the manufacturing version of cloud computing. Cloud computing has been in some of key areas of manufacturing such as IT, pay-as-you-go business models, production scaling up and down per demand, and flexibility in deploying and customizing solutions. In cloud manufacturing, distributed resources are encapsulated into cloud services and managed in a centralized way. Clients can use cloud services according to their requirements. Cloud users can request services ranging from product design, manufacturing, testing, management, and all other stages of a product life cycle.},

abstract = {Manufacturing companies maintain manufacturing knowledge primarily as unstructured text. To facilitate formal use of such knowledge, previous efforts have utilized natural language processing (NLP) to classify manufacturing documents or extract manufacturing concepts/relations. However, extracting more complex knowledge, such as manufacturing rules, has been evasive due to the lack of methods to resolve ambiguities. Specifically, standard NLP techniques do not address domain-specific ambiguities that are due to manufacturing-specific meanings implicit in the text. To address this important gap, we propose an ambiguity resolution method that utilizes domain ontology as the mechanism to incorporate the domain context. We demonstrate its feasibility by extending our previously implemented manufacturing rule extraction framework. The effectiveness of the method is demonstrated by resolving all the domain-specific ambiguities in the dataset and an improvement in correct detection of rules to 70{\%} (increased by about 13{\%}). We expect that this work will contribute to the adoption of semantics-based technology in manufacturing field, by enabling the extraction of precise formal knowledge from text.},

abstract = {In recent years, industrial nations around the globe have invested heavily in new technologies, software, and services to advance digital design and engineering analysis using the digital thread, data analytics, and high performance computing. Many of these initiatives such as Cloud-Based Design and Engineering analysis (CBDEA) fall under the umbrella of what has become known as Industry 4.0 or Industrial Internet. While an increasing number of companies are developing or already offering commercial cloud-based software packages and services for digital design and engineering analysis, little work has been reported on analyzing and documenting the related state-of-the-art as well as identifying potentially critical research gaps to be addressed in advancing this rapidly growing field. The objective of this paper is to present a state-of-the-art review of digital design and engineering analysis software and services that are currently available on the cloud. The main focus of this paper is on assessing the extent to which design and engineering analysis can already be performed based on the software and services accessed through the cloud. In addition, the key capabilities and benefits of these software packages and services are discussed. Based on the assessment of the core features of commercial CBDEA software and service packages, results suggest that almost all phases of a typical design and engineering analysis process can indeed already be conducted through cloud-based software tools and services.},

Companies struggle to evaluate product designs out of a broader, multi-functional perspective to derive the optimal design for the customer and company. The central question which needs to be solved is how companies can overcome these disadvantages in the early stages of product and process development. Based on the existing product design assessment methodologies proposed by academic and industrial communities this paper addresses these problems by developing a novel concept to improve decision-making performance in the early design phase by integrating the complexity perspective into decision-making. The paper delivers a guideline how to build up a complexity index to condense complex information.},

It was based on a retrospective analysis of cases experienced by the author, as well as on the study of certain industries. The systemic model of the technological innovation process presented here, while revisiting the models in the literature, emphasizes the crucial role of the activity of the conception of new ideas and its interaction with other phases of the process. Conception is critical and was, therefore, separated from other activities mainly because it is subject to the action of innovations inhibiting factors. A model for these factors is also presented. The author expects that an enhanced understanding of the innovation process in its complexity and of the action of inhibiting factors will help R{\&}D managers to achieve better success levels.},

abstract = {Aircraft engine technology has evolved and matured over a 70 year period under a continous pressure to become more sustainable, fuel efficient, noise efficient, etc. while ensuring robustness and cost efficiency in production and product operation through life. This paper addresses how current challenges, trends and practices enable the introduction of competitive production and through life operation support into new aircraft engine products. Specifically, the area of structural jet engine sub-structures and components is addressed, where product optimization is dominated by weigth optimization, but also characterised by increased expectations of functionality. As a means, novel manufacturing processes are introduced, and one means is to adopt a so called fabrication approach, where the component is build based on assemlying sub-components with better controlled properties into a component using various joining technologies such as welding. The paper presents a framework based on tigther refining a systems engineering and requirements engineering approach that, combined with a set-based engineering approach, allow for building of re-useable and adaptable engineering methods. Through systematically building this framework, and making use of state of the art modeling and simulation technologies, the introduction of the novel technologies necessarily to increase the engine sub-system performance can be realized without compromizing risk and cost. The paper displays by example some of the challenges that successfully have been addressed, and also some remaining that currently drive development of new practises, methods and tools. In conclusion, a more integrated framework to tie a systems engineering approach with the use of advanced modeling and simulation technologies in a reuseable manner, is a way to balance between product performance and producibility. Still the area is undergoing intence development and challenges for research, development and practice still remain.},

abstract = {The literature on the management of R{\&}D professionals strongly advocates managing R{\&}D projects on a project-by-project basis. This literature suggests that projects should be managed differently depending upon project characteristics such as risk, ambiguity, and nonroutineness. While the primary emphasis of the R{\&}D professional literature has been on project teams, the purpose of this study is to examine the impact of organization-wide controls on innovativeness at the firm level. In a sample of 57 pharmaceutical firms, this study investigates the influence of organizational controls on the research and development activities of R{\&}D professionals. This study is one of a handful of studies that simultaneously explores the use of input, behavior, and output controls. Two categories of innovation are considered as dependent variables: incremental innovations in the form of drug enhancements and radical innovations in the form of new drugs. Contrary to existing theory and hypotheses developed in this study, the results show that input, behavior, and output control enhanced radical innovation, and input and output controls enhanced incremental innovation. These results challenge several important features of existing models of R{\&}D management and diverge from common beliefs about R{\&}D management at the project level. While it is commonly accepted that incremental and radical innovation should be managed differently, the results of this study suggest otherwise. In this instance, the management of R{\&}D activities may be considered more similar than previously thought.},

abstract = {Geometric deviations are inevitably observable on manufactured workpieces and have huge influences on the quality and function of mechanical products. Therefore, many activities in geometric variations management have to be performed to ensure the product function despite the presence of these deviations. Dimensional and Geometrical Product Specification and Verification (GPS) are standards for the description of workpieces. Their lately revision grounds on GeoSpelling, which is a univocal language for geometric product specification and verification and aims at providing a common understanding of geometric specifications in design, manufacturing, and inspection. The Skin Model concept is a basic concept within GeoSpelling and is an abstract model of the physical interface between a workpiece and its environment. In contrast to this understanding, established models for computer-aided modelling and engineering simulations make severe assumptions about the workpiece surface. Therefore, this paper deals with operationalizing the Skin Model concept in discrete geometry for the use in geometric variations management. For this purpose, Skin Model Shapes, which are particular Skin Model representatives from a simulation perspective, are generated. In this regard, a Skin Model Shape is a specific outcome of the conceptual Skin Model and comprises deviations from manufacturing and assembly. The process for generating Skin Model Shapes is split into a prediction and an observation stage with respect to the available information and knowledge about expected geometric deviations. Moreover, applications for these Skin Model Shapes in the context of mechanical engineering are given. 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Interoperability of systems is not a cookie-cutter-function. There are various levels of interoperability between two systems ranging from no interoperability to full interoperability. In the technical domain, various models for levels of interoperability already exist and are used successfully to determine the degree of interoperability between information technology systems. However, such models are not yet established in the domain of conceptual modeling. This paper introduces a general model dealing with various levels of conceptual interoperability that goes beyond the technical reference models for interoperable solutions. The model is intended to become a bridge between the conceptual design and the technical design for implementation, integration, or federation. It should also contribute to the standardization of V{\&}V procedures as well as to the documentation of systems that are designed to be federated. It is furthermore a framework to determine in the early stages of the federation development process whether meaningful interoperability between systems is possible. To this end, the scope of the model goes beyond the implementation level of actual standards, which focus on the exchange of data using standardized formats and interfaces. Another practical application of the model is, that it enhances the only recently published DoD Net-Centric Data Strategy for the Global Information Grid (GIG) and is directly applicable to derive necessary metadata to reach the DoD Data Goal to “enable Data to be understandable.”},

abstract = {The main difficulty associated with a collaborative design process is understanding the product data exchanged during the design. Efficient and effective coordination of design activities relies on a thorough understanding of the dependencies between shared product specifications throughout the entire development cycle. This paper explores the linkages between the design process features and product specification dependencies, and suggests ways of identifying and managing specification dependencies to improve collaborative process performance. Using a UML (Unified Modeling Language) specification, we propose a process traceability tool to track the design process in an ongoing manner. Based on the information captured, the dependencies between specifications involved in the tracked process are identified and inserted in a dependency network, which is maintained throughout the design process. A set of mechanisms is then proposed to qualify the identified dependencies. Extracting and qualifying specification dependencies could be useful in many design situations; for example, during an engineering change management process to assess impacts and study change feasibility, or during a conflict management process to assist designers in resolving conflicts and maintaining the coherence of the design process (knowing that change management is a tool to conduct conflict management). Special attention is paid to the conflict management process. By means of a case study, we show how the solution we propose can assist designers during the conflict management process.},

abstract = {Abstract: The selection of an appropriate resilience investment strategy to optimize the operational efficiency of a seaport is a challenging task given that many criteria need to be considered and modelled under an uncertain environment. The design of such a complex decision system consists of many subjective and imprecise parameters contained in different quantitative and qualitative forms. This paper proposes a fuzzy multi-attribute decision making methodology for the selection of an appropriate resilience investment strategy in a succinct and straightforward manner. The decision support model allows for a collaborative modelling of the system by multiple analysts in a group decision making process. Fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) was utilized to analyse the complex structure of the system to obtain the weights of all the criteria while fuzzy technique for order of preference by similarity to ideal solution (TOPSIS) was employed to facilitate the ranking process of the resilience strategies. Given that it is often financially difficult to invest in all the resilience strategies, it is envisaged that the proposed approach could provide decision makers with a flexible and transparent tool for selecting appropriate resilience strategies aimed at increasing the resilience of seaport operations.},

abstract = {Product competitiveness, shorter product life cycle and increased product varieties are posing mere challenges to the manufacturing industries. The situation poses a need to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of capacity planning and resource optimization while still maintaining their flexibilities. Machine loading - one of the important components of capacity planning is known for its complexity that encompasses various types of flexibilities pertaining to part selection, machine and operation assignment along with constraints. The main objective of the flexible manufacturing system (FMS) is to balance the productivity of the production floor as well as maintaining its flexibility. From the literature, optimization-based methods tend to become impractical when the problem size increases while heuristic-based methods are more robust in their practicality although they may dependent on constraints of individual problems. We adopt a Harmony Search algorithm (HS) to solve this problem that aims on mapping the feasible solution vectors to the domain problem. The objectives are to minimize the system unbalance as well as increase throughput while satisfying the technological constraints such as machine time availability and tool slots. The performance of the proposed algorithm is tested on 10 sample problems available in FMS literature and compared with existing solution methods.},

abstract = {Product lifecycle management (PLM) systems have been gained application at leading areas of industry. By now, they integrate all engineering activities. Product definition in these systems relies upon advanced object modeling and virtual prototyping. However, large models with thousands of strongly related objects brought new problem of thinking and seeing in extensive information structures. New methods are demanded mainly to establish better organized knowledge based parallel interactions by high number of engineers. Fortunately, recent developments in product modeling introduced rules, reactions, function structures, and other active knowledge carriers in product models in order to establish situation and event based product definition. These techniques serve storage and repeated application of engineering knowledge and offer good connection for enhanced knowledge based communication between model generation processes and group work environment in the future. The authors of this paper established a new methodology for enhanced knowledge based connection of human interactions with current product modeling. They utilized their former results and realized coordinated interacting human intent based and product behavior driven adaptive product object definition. The proposed new control of product definition is supported by extended context definition. In this paper, the authors introduce the new product definition methodology and discuss key issues including principle of their Coordinated Request based Product Modeling (CRPM), connection of CRPM to the currently prevailing Classical Product Modeling (CPM), new representations in product behavior related structures, and a new method for the definition of coordinated contextual structure of objectives (SOB) and behaviors (SBE). The proposed modeling is considered as API communicated extension to the CPM modeling in current industrial PLM systems. {\textcopyright} 2012 IEEE.},

Viewing designcommunication as conveying permitted spaces forfurther designing is a useful rationalisationfor understanding what designers need fromtheir notations and computer tools, to achieveclear communication of uncertain ideas. Thepaper presents a typology of ways that designscan be uncertain.

It concludes thatsystematic use of meta-notations for conveyingprovisionality and uncertainty can reduce theseproblems.},

Significant challenges remain for integrating information across the lifecycle and enabling efficient decision-making. In this paper, we explore opportunities for mapping standard data representations, such as the Standard for the Exchange of Product Data (STEP), MTConnect, and the Quality Information Framework (QIF) to integrate information silos existing across the lifecycle. To demonstrate this vision, we describe a reference implementation with a contract manufacturer in the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Smart Manufacturing Systems Test Bed. Using this implementation, we explore how knowledge generated from manufacturing can support lifecycle decision-making. As a case study, we then present an interactive prototype correlating the test bed's data based on the context that must be provided for a specific decision-making viewpoint.},

@article{McMahon2004,
abstract = {Knowledge management is one of the key enabling technologies of distributed engineering enterprises. It encompasses a wide range of organizational, management and technologically orientated approaches that promote the exploitation of an organizations' intellectual assets. Knowledge management approaches may be divided into personalization approaches that emphasize human resources and communication, and codification approaches that emphasize the collection and organization of knowledge. This distinction is used to explore the application of knowledge management in engineering design, after first outlining the engineering circumstances that have led to the current emphasis on the application. The paper then gives an overview of approaches to knowledge management through personalization, including human and organizational approaches, concentrating on the establishment of communities of practice. The role of information technology is explained both in terms of personalization (communication and team support through computer-supported cooperative work) and of codification through information management, knowledge structuring and knowledge-based engineering. The paper concludes with a discussion of the match of knowledge management approach to engineering circumstance, and of the current challenges of knowledge management.

@article{Kahn2006,
abstract = {The following paper was written by the authors over a period. of approximately 16 months during the period November 1993 to May 1995 in an attempt to explore a set of open research issues and to integrate them with certain ideas of a small group of researchers who had been briefed on the notions inherent in the Digital Object Architecture that one of the authors (Kahn) had been developing at the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI). This research group had been organized by CNRI as part of its "Computer Science Technical Reports7quot; (CSTR) project that was funded by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA). The CSTR project had several objectives, of which one was to digitize existing collections of technical reports from five leading computer science departments at universities in the U.S and make the reports available on the Internet. A second objective was to fund research at these institutions on digital libraries, especially research that made good use of their local collections. A third objective was to link heterogeneous electronic libraries, such as were being developed in the program. The difficulties inherent in this third objective ultimately led to this paper. In particular, the motivation arose from a set of concerns first expressed by these researchers at a meeting at CNRI on October 25, 1993 when the Digital Object Architecture was first presented to the research group by Kahn. In the discussion that resulted, many issues emerged, some of which we ultimately decided must be resolved in any architecture, and some of which-perhaps just as crucially-could be deferred for the time being. For example, questions arose about the role of semantics in identifiers; we decided to address them early on. Another issue that proved controversial was how to deal with situations in which the digital objects were actually mobile programs in the network. Since a digital object could contain other digital objects, this led directly to the notion of a mobile repository. The basic question was how best to describe this kind of situation and explain how to access information that was not at a known specific location or IP address on the net. We decided not to cover this aspect of the architecture in the interest of getting closure on the paper. A critical part of this effort was dealing with various ntellectual property issues; and the architecture was designed to take this important aspect into account.We were fortunate to have the help of Ms. Patrice Lyons, an experienced intellectual property lawyer, in the formulation of certain key elements of the architecture dealing with terms and conditions for access to information, and in the drafting of the paper. Although her name does not appear on the paper, her insights and contributions played an important role in the preparation of the paper. One key component of the architecture is a generalpurpose resolution system, known as the Handle System R□, an implementation of which has been operational on the Internet since 1994. At present, close to 50 million identifiers are assigned to digital objects and resolvable by the system, which has been available 7x24 for many years. It is anticipated that the number of resolvable identifiers in the system will grow rapidly and could easily exceed a billion in the not too distant future. Much progress has occurred in the past decade on the remainder of the architectural components, such as repositories, metadata registries, and the associated implementations; and the Handle System continues to evolve to meet new requirements. Uses in both government and the private sector continue to expand. Digital ID World selected the Digital Object Architecture for its 2003 award for balancing innovation with practical reality. Many groups are now using the technology. For example, the International DOI Foundation relies on the Handle System for administering its identifiers, and the Advanced Distributed Learning project, an effort of the U.S. Department of Defense, requires the use of the Handle System for identification of its materials and for resolution of identifiers. Since the mid-1980s, CNRI had been working on various aspects of digital libraries and mobile programs, referred to as "Knowbot programs." Certain key aspects of this work were subsequently written up in a patent application that was filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office prior to its presentation to the research group in late 1993. The purpose of the patent filing was to insure that the technology would not be constrained by others and its integrity could be maintained. It has since been made available by CNRI under an open source license. The CNRI patent was issued in 2000, but during the intervening years significant progress was made by CNRI and by others in implementing key components of the architecture. One reason the Internet was broadly appealing was its openness to applications of all kinds that could use it as an underlying infrastructure. The same basic attribute can be seen in the digital object architecture. It neither constrains the choice of applications, nor mandates how they must be implemented. However, as a powerful reference model, with demonstrated implementations of its components, it enables others to confront difficult system design and implementation projects from a well-formulated starting point that enables, and, more accurately, reinforces the ability for heterogeneous information systems to interoperate with each other. By taking a complex subject and rendering it accessible in simpler terms, it was possible to make a basic set of ideas more understandable to a larger audience. It was not easy to write the paper, and indeed we went through close to a dozen iterations over more than a year in the sometimes elusive search for clarity of expression. We are pleased to see the paper included in this special issue.},

What might it look like and what could it do for us as individuals, our organizations and the web overall? The Decisions and Decision-Making Incubator Group explored this question over the last year, including use cases, requirements and formats for representing decisions in a machine-understandable format. In fact, a standardized decision format would allow the decisions that occur everyday to be managed, archived, shared, and tracked. Two key benefits include the ability to expand and advance the meaningful use of web linked data, as well as the ability to tie-in domain knowledge to provide decision context. This final report captures the major accomplishments and results of the incubator group. The report ends with a recommendation to transition into a W3C Working Group for the establishment of a Decision Markup Language (DecisionML).},

@article{Marshall2012,
abstract = {Members of the W3C Health Care and Life Sciences Interest Group (HCLS IG) have published a variety of genomic and drug-related data sets as Resource Description Framework (RDF) triples. This experience has helped the interest group define a general data workflow for mapping health care and life science (HCLS) data to RDF and linking it with other Linked Data sources. This paper presents the workflow along with four case studies that demonstrate the workflow and addresses many of the challenges that may be faced when creating new Linked Data resources. The first case study describes the creation of linked RDF data from microarray data sets while the second discusses a linked RDF data set created from a knowledge base of drug therapies and drug targets. The third case study describes the creation of an RDF index of biomedical concepts present in unstructured clinical reports and how this index was linked to a drug side-effect knowledge base. The final case study describes the initial development of a linked data set from a knowledge base of small molecules. This paper also provides a detailed set of recommended practices for creating and publishing Linked Data sources in the HCLS domain in such a way that they are discoverable and usable by people, software agents, and applications. These practices are based on the cumulative experience of the Linked Open Drug Data (LODD) task force of the HCLS IG. While no single set of recommendations can address all of the heterogeneous information needs that exist within the HCLS domains, practitioners wishing to create Linked Data should find the recommendations useful for identifying the tools, techniques, and practices employed by earlier developers. In addition to clarifying available methods for producing Linked Data, the recommendations for metadata should also make the discovery and consumption of Linked Data easier.},

abstract = {Nowadays, the management of product geometrical variations during the whole product development process is an important issue for companies' competitiveness. During the design phase, geometric functional requirements and tolerances are derived from the design intent. Furthermore, the manufacturing and measurement stages are two main geometric variations generators according to the two well-known axioms of manufacturing imprecision and measurement uncertainty. GeoSpelling as the basis of the geometrical product specification standard enables a comprehensive modeling framework and an unambiguous language to describe geometric variations covering the overall product lifecycle thanks to a set of concepts and operations based on the fundamental concept of the "Skin Model." In contrast, only few research studies have focused on the skin model representation and simulation. The skin model as a discrete shape model is the main focus of this work. We investigate here discrete shape and variability modeling fundamentals, Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation techniques and statistical shape analysis methods to represent, simulate, and analyze skin models. By means of a case study based on a cross-shaped sheet metal part, the results of the skin model simulations are shown here, and the performances of the simulations are described. IMechE 2012.},

abstract = {In this era of web applications, web shopping portals have become increasingly popular as they allow customers to buy products from home. These websites often request the customers to rate their products and write reviews, which helps the manufacturers to improve the quality of their products and other customers in choosing the right product or service. The rapid increase in the popularity of e-commerce has increased the number of customers in these type of web-shopping portals, leading to an enormous number of reviews for each product or service. Each of these reviews may describe the different features of the products. Hence, the customer has to go through a large number of reviews before s/he can arrive to a fully informed decision on whether to buy the product or not. In this paper, we describe a system, which automatically extracts the product features from the reviews and determines if they have been expressed in a positive or a negative way by the reviewers. The proposed algorithm works in two steps, viz feature extraction and polarity classification. We use association rule mining to identify the most characteristic features of a product. In the second step we develop a supervised machine learning algorithm based polarity classifier that determines the sentiment of the review sentences with respect to the prominent features. Our experiments on the benchmark reviews of five popular products show that our classifier is highly efficient and achieves an accuracy of 79.67{\%}. We did not make use of any domain specific resources and tools, and thus our classifier is domain-independent, and can be used for the similar tasks in other domains. 2014 IEEE.},

abstract = {From interviewing developers and analyzing examples from industry, the authors have concluded that communication issues during the design process are a key factor of the complexity of product development. These communication issues stem from a lack of insight in the workflow between designers and their resources, and the lack of insight in the relation of this workflow to the system architecture. To the best knowledge of the authors, currently there are no suitable models and tools that allow capturing and understanding such information in an integrated way. This work contributes by providing requirements for tools and models, and proposes a modeling language that fulfils such requirements. With this language we introduce a method for capturing design process information: The language can combine multiple stakeholder-based views on their system aspects of interest with architectural concerns, and can specify which resources in terms of models and parametric information are needed from other stakeholders to develop these aspects. The language was also developed as a stepping stone for automation of design processes. 2011 by ASME.},

abstract = {In this paper, an approach to design information systems for traceability is proposed. The paper applies gozinto graph modelling for traceability of the goods flow. A gozinto graph represents a graphical listing of raw materials, parts, intermediates and subassemblies, which a process transforms into an end product, through a sequence of operations. Next, the graphical listing has been translated into a reference data model that is the basis for designing an information system for tracking and tracing. Materials that are modelled this way represent production and/or purchase lots or batches. The composition of a certain end product is then represented through modelling all its constituent materials along with their intermediate relations. By registering all relations between sub-ordinate and super-ordinate material lots, a method of tracking the composition of the end product is obtained. When the entire sequence of operations required for manufacturing an end product adheres to this registering of relations, a multilevel bill of lots can be compiled. That bill of lots then, provides the necessary information to determine the composition of a material item out of component items. These composition data can be used to recall any items having consumed a certain component of specific interest (e.g., deficient), but also to certify product quality or to pro-actively adjust production processes to optimise the product quality in relation to its production characteristics (e.g., scarcity, costs or time).},

abstract = {A common way of dynamically scheduling jobs in a manufacturing system is by implementing dispatching rules. The issues with this method are that the performance of these rules depends on the state the system is in at each moment and also that no ideal single rule exists for all the possible states that the system may be in. Therefore, it would be interesting to use the most appropriate dispatching rule for each instance. To achieve this goal, a scheduling approach that uses machine learning can be used. Analyzing the previous performance of the system (training examples) by means of this technique, knowledge is obtained that can be used to decide which is the most appropriate dispatching rule at each moment in time. In this paper, a literature review of the main machine learning based scheduling approaches from the last decade is presented. Copyright 2014 Cambridge University Press.},

abstract = {The cognitive challenges in the design of complex engineered systems include the scale and scope of decision problems, nonlinearity of the trade space, subjectivity of the problem formulation, and the need for rapid decision making. These challenges have motivated an active area of research in design decision-support methods and the development of commercial and openly available design frameworks. Although these frameworks are extremely capable, most are limiting as a basis for research relating to design decision support because they offer little user flexibility for incorporating and evaluating new features or techniques. This paper describes Rave (www.rave.gatech.edu), a computational framework designed specifically as a research platform for design decision-support methods. Rave has been structured to be flexible and adaptable, handle data with systematic data structures and descriptive metadata, facilitate a wide spectrum of visualization types, provide features to enable user interactivity and linking of graphics, and incorporate surrogate modeling and optimization as enabling capabilities. This framework is envisioned to provide the research and industrial communities an easily expandable and customizable baseline capability to facilitate investigation of further design decision-support advancements.

@article{Du2014,
abstract = {Product family design is generally characterized by two types of approaches: module-based and scale-based. While the former aims to enable product variety based on module configuration, the latter is to variegate product design by scaling up or down certain design parameters. The prevailing practice is to treat module configuration and scaling design as separate decisions or aggregate two design problems as a single-level, all-in-one optimization problem. In practice, optimization of scaling variables is always enacted within a specific modular platform; and meanwhile an optimal module configuration depends on how design parameters are to be scaled. The key challenge is how to deal with explicitly the coupling of these two design optimization problems. This paper formulates a Stackelberg game theoretic model for joint optimization of product family configuration and scaling design, in which a bilevel decision structure reveals coupled decision making between module configuration and parameter scaling. A bilevel mixed 0-1 non-linear programming model is developed and solved, comprising an upper-level optimization problem and a lower-level optimization problem. The upper level seeks for an optimal configuration of modules and module attributes by maximizing the shared surplus of an entire product family. The lower level entails parametric optimization of attribute values for optimal technical performance of each individual module. A case study of electric motors demonstrates that the bilevel joint optimization model excels in leveraging optimal scaling in conjunction with optimal module configuration, which is advantageous over the existing paradigm of product family scaling design that cannot change the product family configuration.

The academic literature on Web-based DSS is largely focused on applications and implementations, and only a few articles examine architectural issues or provide design guidelines based on empirical evidence.},

abstract = {The Open Services for Lifecycle Collaboration (OSLC) initiative is creating a family of web services specifications for products, services and other tools that support all phases of the software and product lifecycle. The purpose of these specifications is to enable integration between products that support Application Life-cycle Management (ALM) and Product Life-cycle Management (PLM). Each part of the lifecycle or domain has its own group and specification, for example there are Change Management, Quality Management, Estimation {\&} Measurement and more. Each of the domain specifications are built upon this core specification.

This OSLC Core Specification sets out the common features that every OSLC Service can be expected to support using terminology from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C). New terminology that we introduce can be found in the glossary section below. This specification is mostly about OSLC Services, it specifies what OSLC Services MUST, SHOULD and MAY do. It also contains some required behaviors for OSLC clients and rules for OSLC domain specifications that extend this specification.

OSLC Services are accessible via a Service Provider Resource that describes the Services offered. Each Service can provide Creation Factories for resource creation, Query Capabilities for resource query and Delegated UI Dialogs to enable clients to create and select resources via a web UI. Query Capabilities and Creation Factories may offer Resource Shapes that describe the properties of resources managed by the service. This is illustrated in the diagram below. See the section below on Service Provider Resources for further discussion of these concepts.},

abstract = {This report presents a revised version of the Core Product Model (CPM) initially reported in [1]. The initial CPM was intended to provide a base-level product model that is: not tied to any specific application or software; open; non-proprietary; simple; generic; expandable; independent of any product development process; and capable of capturing all product information shared throughout the product's lifecycle. The revisions presented continue to support these intentions. The objectives of the report are: (1) to document the changes in the CPM relative to the initial version; (2) to describe in detail the revised CPM, represented as a UML class diagram; (3) to show, through Java and XML implementations, how the CPM can be used as the basis, or organizing principle, of a product information-modeling framework that can support the full range of product design information; and (4) to present a rational, model-based process for converting a CPM supporting the early conceptual phases of design into an implementation-level operational database support system. UML, XML and Java representations of the model are presented so as to provide interoperability with other models. A case study example is discussed and its XML representation is presented and analyzed to illustrate the principal elements of the revised CPM.},

@article{Witherell2010,
abstract = {This paper presents the use of first-order logic to improve upon currently employed engineering design knowledge management techniques. Specifically, this work uses description logic in unison with Horn logic, to not only guide the knowledge acquisition process but also to offer much needed support in decision making during the engineering design process in a distributed environment. The knowledge management methods introduced are highlighted by the ability to identify modeling knowledge inconsistencies through the recognition of model characteristic limitations, such as those imposed by model idealizations. The adopted implementation languages include the Semantic Web Rule Language, which enables Horn-like rules to be applied to an ontological knowledge base and the Semantic Web's native Web Ontology Language. As part of this work, an ontological tool, OPTEAM, was developed to capture key aspects of the design process through a set of design-related ontologies and to serve as an application platform for facilitating the engineering design process. The design, analysis, and optimization of a classical I-beam problem are presented as a test-bed case study to illustrate the capabilities of these ontologies in OPTEAM. A second, more extensive test-bed example based on an industry-supplied medical device design problem is also introduced. Results indicate that well-defined, networked relationships within an ontological knowledge base can ultimately lead to a refined design process, with guidance provided by the identification of infeasible solutions and the introduction of "best-case" alternatives. These case studies also show how the application of first-order logic to engineering design improves the knowledge acquisition, knowledge management, and knowledge validation processes.

For engineering, design, manufacturing, and physics-based simulation data this requires formats that are accessible potentially indefinitely into the future. One of the fundamental challenges is the development of digital geometry-centric engineering representations that are self describing and assured to be interpretable over the long lifespans required by archival applications. Additionally, future users may have needs that require other information, going beyond geometry, be also accessible to fully interpret the model. These problems are highly interdisciplinary and not exclusively algorithmic or technical. To provide context, the paper introduces a case study illustrating an overall portrait of the problem. Based on observations from this case study, we present a framework for enhancing the preservation of geometry-centric engineering knowledge. This framework is currently being used on a number of projects in engineering education.},

To explain it, a novel Digital Object Memory (DOMe) based model in automated surface roughness monitoring and data storage in turning is proposed. The model allows automated interaction between workpiece (WP) and machine tool using RFID based smart environment. As a result, WP on-board g-code for turning and machine tool based real time cutting signals are combined into algorithm to measure indirect surface roughness of WP. Moreover, surface roughness value for every cut can be stored on-board of WP to detect the WP history and quality all over the product life cycle. Also framework for DOMe based hand work station monitoring and assistance system is proposed. Smart environment creates compatibility between parts and products on working area to double check workers attentions and to give assistance to workers for avoiding mistakes.},

abstract = {The future of manufacturing lies in being able to optimize the use of resources to produce high quality product and adapt quickly to changing conditions. From smaller lot sizes, to more customization, to sudden changes in supply chain; the variability that manufacturers face is rapidly increasing. A key to enabling adaptive and smart manufacturing systems is the appropriate definition and use of information. Standards are fundamental 1) to facilitate the delivery of the right information at the right time, 2) to enable actions based on that information and 3) to reduce risk of technology adoption and development. This paper provides a review of the standards - a standards landscape - in which future smart manufacturing systems will operate. The landscape focuses on standards used to integrate within and across three manufacturing lifecycle dimensions: product, production system, and business. Opportunities and challenges for new standards are discussed. Emerging activities addressing these opportunities are presented. This paper will allow manufacturing practitioners to better understand the standards useful to integrate smart manufacturing technologies within their areas of expertise.},

abstract = {To satisfy new market requirements, manufacturing industry has shifted from mass production that takes advantage of the scale of production, to quality management that optimizes the internal enterprise functions, to e-manufacturing era that leverage intellectual capital via collaborative innovation. In the same time, the product itself is becoming the most important asset for sustainable business success. Consequently, the effectiveness, efficiency and innovation for the development of the product across the whole product lifecycle are becoming key business factors for manufacturing enterprise to obtain competitive advantages for survival. To tackle such challenges, a new business model called collaborative product services in virtual enterprise is proposed in this paper. The architecture of this new model is developed based on the framework and the application of web service and process management for collaboration product service in virtual enterprise. Indeed, it is hoped that this architecture will lay the foundation for further research and development of effective product lifecycle management in virtually collaborative enterprise environment.},

abstract = {Industry competitiveness depends on the cost, performance, and timely delivery of the product. Thus, an accurate, rapid, and robust product cost estimation model for the entire product life cycle is essential. This research applies two machine learning methods ? back-propagation neural networks (BPNs) and least squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs) ? to solve product life cycle cost estimation problems. The performance of a number of cost estimation models, statistical regression analyses, BPNs and LS-SVMs, are compared in terms of their performance. The estimation results and performance reveal that both LS-SVMs and BPNs can both provide more accurate performance than conventional models. We also make the first attempt to combine LS-SVMs and data transformation (DT) techniques to solve the outlier problem in the cost database. The cost estimation of airframe structure manufacturing was used to evaluate the feasibility of this novel combining mechanism. Finally, a more accurate, available, and generalisable cost estimation model is presented. This research can serve as a useful reference for product cost planning and control in industries.},

abstract = {The availability of integrated, high quality information is a pre-requisite for a decision support system (DSS) to aid in the decision-making process. The introduction of semantic web ensures the seamless integration of information derived from diverse sources and transforms the DSS to an adoptable and flexible Semantic Web-DSS (Web-DSS). However, due to the monotonic nature of the layered development of semantic web, it lacks the capability to represent, reason and integrate incomplete and conflicting information. This, in turn, renders an enterprise incapable of knowledge integration; that is, integration of information about a subject that could potentially be incomplete, inconsistent and distributed among different Web-DSS within or across enterprises. In this article, we address the issues of incomplete and inconsistent semantic information and knowledge integration by using argumentation and argumentation schemes. We discuss the Argumentation-enabled Information Integration Web-DSS (Web@IDSS) along with its syntax and semantics for semantic information integration, and devise a methodology for sharing the results of Web@IDSS in Argument Interchange Format (AIF) format. We also discuss Argumentation-enabled Knowledge Integration Web-DSS (Web@KIDSS) for semantic knowledge integration. We provide formal syntax and semantics for the Web@KIDSS, propose a conceptual framework, and describe it in detail. We present the algorithms for knowledge integration and the prototype application for validation of results.},

abstract = {Supporting different stakeholder viewpoints across the product lifecycle requires semantic richness to represent product-related information and enable multiview engineering simulations. This paper proposes a multilevel product modeling framework enabling stakeholders to define product models and relate them to physical or simulated instances. The framework is defined within the Model-Driven Architecture using the multilevel (data, model, metamodel) approach. The data level represents real-world products, the model level describes models (product models) of real-world products, and the metamodel level describes models of the product models. The metamodel defined in this paper is specialized from a web ontology language enabling product designers to express the semantics of product models in an engineering-friendly way. The interactions between these three levels are described to show how each level in the framework is used in a product engineering context. A product design scenario and user interface for the product metamodel is provided for further understanding of the framework.},

abstract = {In 1996, Dr. Joseph T. Wells, CFE, CPA, founder and Chairman of the ACFE, directed the publication of the first Report to the Nation on Occupational Fraud and Abuse. That study was a truly groundbreaking effort. Analyzing actual case in-formation provided by Certified Fraud Examiners, the report presented statistical data on the cost of occupational fraud, the perpetrators, the victims, and the various methods used to commit these crimes. This was the first study of its kind, and the findings in the 1996 report serve as the foundation for much of what we now know about how occupational fraud and abuse affects organizations. It might be hard for some readers to understand or recall just how little we knew about occupational fraud twenty years ago, but until the release of the first report, there was virtually no statistical information available on the cost, frequency, methodology, or any other aspect of occupational fraud. Those who worked in the fraud examination field knew the problem was huge, but no one could say precisely how large, and this made it very difficult to explain to organizations and clients what a tremendous threat they faced. If there is one great contribution the Report to the Nations has made to the anti-fraud community, it has been in helping to raise the general level of awareness about fraud risk. We now live in a world where virtually all business and gov-ernment organizations understand that fraud is a threat they must deal with. That was most certainly not the case in 1996. The challenge of preventing and detecting these crimes is still formidable, but recognizing the threat is the first step, and we are honored to know that information contained in the past eight editions of the report has been used by anti-fraud professionals throughout the world to educate their employers and clients. On behalf of the ACFE, I am proud to present the 2016 edition of the Report to the Nations, our ninth and most exten-sive study to date. I believe the information contained in this report will be of great value to anti-fraud practitioners, business leaders, government officials, academics, the media, and anyone else with an interest in understanding the tremendous economic threat posed by occupational fraud.},

abstract = {The important issue of mechanical assemblies has been a subject of intense research over the past several years. Most electromechanical products are assemblies of several components, for various technical as well as economic reasons. This paper provides an object-oriented definition of an assembly model called the Open Assembly Model (OAM) and defines an extension to the NIST Core Product Model (NIST-CPM). The assembly model represents the function, form, and behavior of the assembly and defines both a system level conceptual model and associated hierarchical relationships. The model provides a way for tolerance representation and propagation, kinematics representation, and engineering analysis at the system level. The assembly model is open so as to enable plug-and-play with various applications, such as analysis (FEM, tolerance, assembly), process planning, and virtual assembly (using VR techniques). With the advent of the Internet more and more products are designed and manufactured globally in a distributed and collaborative environment. The class structure defined in OAM can be used by designers to collaborate in such an environment. The proposed model includes both assembly as a concept and assembly as a data structure. For the latter it uses STEP. The OAM together with CPM can be used to capture the assembly evolution from the conceptual to the detailed design stages. It is expected that the proposed OAM will enhance the assembly information content in the STEP standard. A case study example is discussed to explain the Usecase analysis of the assembly model.},

In this article, we discuss the use of Semantic Web technology for assembling and querying biomedical knowledge from multiple sources and disciplines. We present the Neurocommons prototype knowledge base, a demonstration intended to show the feasibility and benefits of using these technologies. The prototype knowledge base can be used to experiment with and assess the scalability of current tools and methods for creating such a resource, and to elicit issues that will need to be addressed in order to expand the scope and use of it. We demonstrate the utility of the knowledge base by reviewing a few example queries that provide answers to precise questions relevant to the understanding of disease. All components of the knowledge base are freely available at http://neurocommons.org/, enabling readers to reconstruct the knowledge base and experiment with this new technology.},

The development of isolated computer applications was recognized as a potential problem, leading to the definition of the Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) concept, seeking to achieve the local integration of systems. The introduction and development of the internet have since provided a decisive advancement in the communications infrastructure. We can now capitalize on recent advances in computer graphic visualization and distributed information management systems, in order to positively impact product development and realization and to develop objective risk mitigation strategies on a global basis. In this context, Digital Enterprise Technology (DET) can be defined as 'the collection of systems and methods for the digital modelling of the global product development and realization process, in the context of lifecycle management'. This paper introduces the concept of DET and reviews the status of the design and manufacturing planning integration that is fundamental for the definition and development of DET methods and systems.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2017 IEEE. Analysis models, such as discrete event simulation models, are used to support design and operation of discrete event logistics systems (DELS). The time and expertise required to construct these analysis models can be significantly reduced by automatically generating them from formal models of the systems being analyzed. DELS analysis models can be constructed from system abstractions much more reliably when the system and analysis are specified at compatible levels of abstraction. Formal modeling languages, such as those used in object-orientation, make abstraction explicit, simplifying the mappings between system and analysis models and increasing reusability of the integration. In this paper, we propose fundamental abstractions for DELS and identify corresponding libraries of analysis models. These are used in a system-analysis integration methodology that incorporates abstraction as an explicit step, providing a path to refine and extend those abstractions and model libraries to generate analysis models.},

abstract = {In traditional approaches, process planning and scheduling are carried out sequentially, where scheduling is done separately after the process plan has been generated. However, the functions of these two systems are usually complementary. The traditional approach has become an obstacle to improve the productivity and responsiveness of the manufacturing system. If the two systems can be integrated more tightly, greater performance and higher productivity of a manufacturing system can be achieved. Therefore, the research on the integrated process planning and scheduling (IPPS) problem is necessary. In this paper, a new active learning genetic algorithm based method has been developed to facilitate the integration and optimization of these two systems. Experimental studies have been used to test the approach, and the comparisons have been made between this approach and some previous approaches to indicate the adaptability and superiority of the proposed approach. The experimental results show that the proposed approach is a promising and very effective method on the research of the IPPS problem. 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Challenges that arise in adhering to these principles such as cooperation between autonomous entities and potential for chaotic behaviour are discussed. Finally, heterarchical control is described for arrival time of parts at a machine where using local feedback control, system stability and convergence to meritorious states can be guaranteed, leading to confidence in system performance.},

Creating a functional architecture for a new system is as much an art form as a science and often relies on the tacit knowledge of the systems architect. In this paper, we present a method to integrate analyses to support the refinement of the functional architecture. This method relies on integrating the description of the functional architecture with a formal network description and using that formal network description to provide access to analysis generation technologies. The result is automated access to analysis tools, such as discrete event simulations, which provide critical feedback on the performance of a particular design early in the design process.},

abstract = {Cloud-based design manufacturing (CBDM) refers to a service-oriented networked product development model in which service consumers are enabled to configure, select, and utilize customized product realization resources and services ranging from computer-aided engineering software to reconfigurable manufacturing systems. An ongoing debate on CBDM in the research community revolves around several aspects such as definitions, key characteristics, computing architectures, communication and collaboration processes, crowdsourcing processes, information and communication infrastructure, programming models, data storage, and new business models pertaining to CBDM. One question, in particular, has often been raised: is cloud-based design and manufacturing actually a new paradigm, or is it just “old wine in new bottles”? To answer this question, we discuss and compare the existing definitions for CBDM, identify the essential characteristics of CBDM, define a systematic requirements checklist that an idealized CBDM system should satisfy, and compare CBDM to other relevant but more traditional collaborative design and distributed manufacturing systems such as web- and agent-based design and manufacturing systems. To justify the conclusion that CBDM can be considered as a new paradigm that is anticipated to drive digital manufacturing and design innovation, we present the development of a smart delivery drone as an idealized CBDM example scenario and propose a corresponding CBDM system architecture that incorporates CBDM-based design processes, integrated manufacturing services, information and supply chain management in a holistic sense.},

abstract = {The rapid rise in technologies for data collection has created an unmatched opportunity to advance the use of data-rich tools for lifecycle decision-making. However, the usefulness of these technologies is limited by the ability to translate lifecycle data into actionable insights for human decision-makers. This is especially true in the case of sustainable lifecycle design (SLD), as the assessment of environmental impacts, and the feasibility of making corresponding design changes, often relies on human expertise and intuition. Supporting human sensemaking in SLD requires the use of both data-driven and user-driven methods while exploring lifecycle data. A promising approach for combining the two is through the use of visual analytics (VA) tools. Such tools can leverage the ability of computer-based tools to gather, process, and summarize data along with the ability of human experts to guide analyses through domain knowledge or data-driven insight. In this paper, we review previous research that has created VA tools in SLD. We also highlight existing challenges and future opportunities for such tools in different lifecycle stages—design, manufacturing, distribution and supply chain, use-phase, end-of-life (EoL), as well as life cycle assessment (LCA). Our review shows that while the number of VA tools in SLD is relatively small, researchers are increasingly focusing on the subject matter. Our review also suggests that VA tools can address existing challenges in SLD and that significant future opportunities exist.},

With the IoT technologies such as radio frequency identification (RFID) implemented in manufacturing sites, enormous data will be generated. Such data are so complex, abstract, and variable so that it is difficult to make full use of the data which carry great myriad of useful information and knowledge. This paper presents a visualization approach for the RFID-enabled shopfloor logistics Big Data from Cloud Manufacturing. An innovative RFID-Cuboid model is used for reconstructing the RFID raw data given the production logic and time series. Several contributions are highlighted. Firstly, a possible approach to integrate IoT and Cloud Manufacturing is introduced to upgrade and transform the traditional industry for an intelligent future. Secondly, an RFID-Cuboid model is proposed by using the production logic and time stamps to chain the RFID data so that the data could be interpreted. Thirdly, a real-life case is reported to show the feasibility and practicality of the proposed visualization approach to help different end-users to ease their daily operations. Lessons and insights from this case are meaningful for the implementation of IoT-enabled Cloud Manufacturing and Big Data analytics in industry field.},

abstract = {This paper describes the design and performance analysis of a control system for rotorcraft with an emphasis on the requirements called for by autonomous guidance. To be able to track trajectories, such as those generated by a guidance system, a path following controller is used in combination with a velocity control augmentation. The path following system is motivated by nonlinear stability analysis. The velocity control augmentation follows a loop-shaping design for the inner-loop attitude control and a dynamic inversion velocity control design for the outer-loop. The identified model of the dynamics along with the uncertainties is used to determine the robustness and performance of the velocity control system. Finally, the paper presents a novel method to evaluate the overall performance of the control system in terms of the tracking error statistics. These results are then used to determine a tracking error model, which can be used to predict the tracking error for a given reference.},

@article{Galanakis2006,
abstract = {Several theories have been developed and try to communicate to managers how innovation occurs in a firm and which factors affect the outcome of this process. These theories come from different perspectives that either focus on management, economic or social sciences and create a complex net. This complexity often makes managers take a decision, the outcome of which contradicts their original aims. The objectives of this paper are to communicate innovation theory to the different actors in the system under a common perspective and to reveal the complexity of innovation systems. The new concept has at its centre the firm, which is the generator and promoter of innovations in the market, the industrial sector and the nation. The model's main focus is the Knowledge Creation from public or industrial research; the New Product Design and Development process, and the Product Success in the market. This process is affected by other internal factors of the firm as well as by the National Innovation Environment. This innovation system has been codified, under a system dynamics approach, to create a model, the ‘Creative Factory' that includes all the aspects that academia, a firm or the policy making bodies need to consider around innovation activity.},

abstract = {Design for sustainable manufacturing enterprise (DFSME) is considered to be a new ideologue regarding survival of manufacturing enterprise and it can also be considered as one of the most important solutions to deal with the existing global financial crisis. The DFSME is a systemic approach that simultaneously determines the aspects of sustainability and how they can be aggregated taking into consideration the globalisation issues. The problem addressed in this paper is how to present the concepts of sustainability to guide manufacturing enterprises analysts and designers with the most effective aspects for analysing sustainability. These aspects are: international issues; contemporary issues; innovative products; reconfigurable manufacturing systems; manufacturing strategies; business models; flexible organisation management; manufacturing strategies and performance measurements. Based on these aspects, the sustainable model will be analysed and presented through covering all aspects of sustainable manufacturing enterprise and the sustainability assessment will be measured. The ultimate goal of this paper is to consider the needs of manufacturing enterprise throughout most of the world to be sustainable as well as to be globalised enterprises. This analysis shows that the DFSME is a very large task and should be taken into consideration as one aspect of the next industrial revolution.},

abstract = {A number of manufacturing companies have reported anecdotal evidence describing the benefits of Model-Based Enterprise (MBE). Based on this evidence, major players in industry have embraced a vision to deploy MBE. In our view, the best chance of realizing this vision is the creation of a single "digital thread." Under MBE, there exists a Model-Based Definition (MBD), created by the Engineering function, that downstream functions reuse to complete Model-Based Manufacturing and Model-Based Inspection activities. The ensemble of data that enables the combination of model-based definition, manufacturing, and inspection defines this digital thread. Such a digital thread would enable real-time design and analysis, collaborative process-flow development, automated artifact creation, and full-process traceability in a seamless real-time collaborative development among project participants. This paper documents the strengths and weaknesses in the current, industry strategies for implementing MBE. It also identifies gaps in the transition and/or exchange of data between various manufacturing processes. Lastly, this paper presents measured results from a study of model-based processes compared to drawing-based processes and provides evidence to support the anecdotal evidence and vision made by industry.},

abstract = {Purpose - The use of AI for operations management, with its ability to evolve solutions, handle uncertainty and perform optimisation continues to be a major field of research. The growing body of publications over the last two decades means that it can be difficult to keep track of what has been done previously, what has worked, and what really needs to be addressed. Hence, the purpose of this paper is to present a survey of the use of AI in operations management aimed at presenting the key research themes, trends and directions of research. Design/methodology/approach - The paper builds upon our previous survey of this field which was carried out for the ten-year period 1995-2004. Like the previous survey, it uses Elsevier's Science Direct database as a source. The framework and methodology adopted for the survey is kept as similar as possible to enable continuity and comparison of trends. Thus, the application categories adopted are: design; scheduling; process planning and control; and quality, maintenance and fault diagnosis. Research on utilising neural networks, case-based reasoning (CBR), fuzzy logic (FL), knowledge-Based systems (KBS), data mining, and hybrid AI in the four application areas are identified. Findings - The survey categorises over 1,400 papers, identifying the uses of AI in the four categories of operations management and concludes with an analysis of the trends, gaps and directions for future research. The findings include: the trends for design and scheduling show a dramatic increase in the use of genetic algorithms since 2003 that reflect recognition of their success in these areas; there is a significant decline in research on use of KBS, reflecting their transition into practice; there is an increasing trend in the use of FL in quality, maintenance and fault diagnosis; and there are surprising gaps in the use of CBR and hybrid methods in operations management that offer opportunities for future research. Originality/value - This is the largest and most comprehensive study to classify research on the use of AI in operations management to date. The survey and trends identified provide a useful reference point and directions for future research. 2011 Emerald Group Publishing Limited. All rights reserved.},

Requirements are collected from manufacturing companies and combined with insights from literature in the field of current ERP/MES system drawbacks, advantages, needs and challenges. The findings show that the needs and challenges in data integration inside SME networks are closely related to the limitations of current supply chain solutions. Current ERP-solutions lack extended enterprise support and a shared cloud-based approach. On the other hand, current MES solutions can operate the manufacturing process, but not for distributed manufacturing. As an answer to the requirements, we made a proposal for the core of architecture for next generation of MES solution in this position paper. Moreover, a pilot software tool has been developed to support the needs related to real time, cloud-based, light weight operation.},

abstract = {The report presents a core model for representing design information, motivated by the perceived needs of next-generation product development systems and drawing content- level requirements from a related study of design information flows. The core model was synthesized from a comparison of several independently-developed design artifact representations. The primary objective of the report is to provide a base-level product model that is: not tied to any vendor software; open; non-proprietary; simple; generic; expandable; independent of any one product development process; and capable of capturing the engineering context that is most commonly shared in product development activities. The core model focuses on artifact representation including function, form, behavior and material, physical and functional decompositions, and relationships among these concepts. The model is heavily influenced by the Entity-Relationship data model; accordingly, it consists of two sets of classes, called object and relationship, equivalent to the UML class and association class, respectively. It is expected that the core model may eventually serve as a precursor for STEP in the lifecycle of a product, capturing all information relevant to the ongoing design process until the product design is firmed up, approved and committed to purchasing or manufacturing. Aspects of extensions of the model in these directions are discussed.},

abstract = {The measuring process using a CMM involves a large amount of data. It is necessary to understand and clearly define the data required by the measuring process and the relationships of these data before incorporating automation into a CMM system. This paper uses the IDEF0 model to analyse the measuring function requirements for solving the problem of ambiguous internal information flow and material flow during the measuring process. A data module for the CMM measuring system was developed using the EXPRESS language in STEP, to support the IDEF0 function process module. An information flow design model was also established, which integrated the IDEF0 process requirement analysis model and the EXPRESS data module. The objective is to enhance the efficiency of the development of measuring systems by system designers, and to provide a basis for future development of measuring information systems using STEP data formats.},

abstract = {Integrated supplier selection and order allocation is an important decision for both designing and operating supply chains. This decision is often influenced by the concerned stakeholders, suppliers, plant operators and customers in different tiers. As firms continue to seek competitive advantage through supply chain design and operations they aim to create optimized supply chains. This calls for on one hand consideration of multiple conflicting criteria and on the other hand consideration of uncertainties of demand and supply. Although there are studies on supplier selection using advanced mathematical models to cover a stochastic approach, multiple criteria decision making techniques and multiple stakeholder requirements separately, according to authors׳ knowledge there is no work that integrates these three aspects in a common framework. This paper proposes an integrated method for dealing with such problems using a combined Analytic Hierarchy Process–Quality Function Deployment (AHP–QFD) and chance constrained optimization algorithm approach that selects appropriate suppliers and allocates orders optimally between them. The effectiveness of the proposed decision support system has been demonstrated through application and validation in the bioenergy industry.},

abstract = {Trust in product-data quality (PDQ) is critical to successful implementation of model-based enterprise (MBE).Such trust does not extend to the exchange and reuse of three-dimensional (3D)-product models across the product lifecycle because verifiable traceability in product data is lacking. This assurance is especially crucial when “siloed” manufacturing functions produce product data that is not fully interoperable and thus requires frequent reworking to enable reuse. Previous research showed how Public Key Infrastructure (X.509-PKI) from the X.509 standard could be used to embed digital signatures into product data for the purposes of certification and trace-ability. This paper first provides an overview and review of technologies that could be integrated to support trust throughout the product lifecycle. The paper then proposes a trust structure that supports several data-transaction types. Next, the paper presents a case study for common configuration management (CM) workflows that are typically found in regulated industries. Finally, the paper draws conclusions and provides recommendations for further research for enabling the product lifecycle of trust (PLOT).},

Manufacturing is facing unprecedented challenges due to increased variety, market volatility and distributed global manufacturing. A fundamental residue of globalization and market uncertainty is the increasing complexity of manufacturing, technological and economic systems. The nature and sources of complexity in these areas are reviewed and complexity modeling and management approaches are discussed. Enterprises that can mitigate the negative aspects of complexity while managing its positives should thrive on the continuous change and increasing complexity. To reap these benefits in the future, manufacturing companies need to not only adopt flexible technical solutions but must also effectively innovate and manage complex socio-technical systems.},

abstract = {Design optimization in market system research commonly relies on Discrete choice analysis (DCA) to forecast sales and revenues for different product variants. Conventional DCA, which represents consumer choice as a compensatory process through maximization of a smooth utility function, has proven to be reasonably accurate at predicting choice and interfaces easily with engineering models. However, the marketing literature has documented significant improvement in modeling choice with the use of models that incorporate both noncompensatory (descriptive) and compensatory (predictive) components. This noncompensatory component can, for example, model a "consider-then-choose" process in which potential customers first narrow their decisions to a small set of products using noncompensatory screening rules and then employ a compensatory evaluation to select from within this consideration set. This article presents solutions to a design optimization challenge that arises when demand is modeled with a consider-then-choose model: the choice probabilities are no longer continuous or continuously differentiable. We examine two different classes of methods to solve optimal design problems-genetic algorithms (GAs) and nonlinear programming (NLP) relaxations based on complementarity constraints-for consider-then-choose models whose screening rules are based on conjunctive (logical "and") rules.},

abstract = {Product development processes comprise highly creative and knowledge-intensive tasks that involve extensive information exchange and communication among geographically distributed teams. Due to the geographical and institutional separation between the different systems involved in the product lifecycle, product knowledge sharing is becoming a key issue in the information systems of extended enterprises. This paper addresses the issue and challenges of product knowledge traceability during the product development. The aim of this research effort is to enhance the sharing and use of product knowledge acquired during the development process using traceability information. A standardized approach is proposed to trace and share product knowledge and key constructs to support traceability during the product development process are identified and formalized. This research effort is based on the premise that an important step towards achieving product knowledge sharing is providing traceability across various product knowledge elements that are used in product development phases, i.e. design and manufacturing. Two disjointed but complementary case studies illustrating the benefit of traceability are presented. The potential role of traceability is described, first to support the decision making process during engineering change management (ECM), and second to support product-oriented modelling for knowledge sharing and exchanging to meet the quality requirements. The proposed approach has been implemented using the MEGA Suite tool and applied to each of the case studies and could be integrated to PLM systems currently in use.},

@article{Pandey2014,
abstract = {Optimization is an indispensable tool in decision based design (DBD). There is an emerging consensus in DBD that the only correct objective to maximize is the decision maker's utility from a design. However, a utility function assessed a priori may not capture the preferences of the decision maker over the entire design space. As a result, when the optimizer searches for the optimal design, it may traverse (or end up) in regions in the design space where the preference order among different solutions is different from that used to build the utility function. For a highly non-convex design space, this can lead to convergence to a grossly suboptimal design depending on where we start the solution search. In this article, we propose two approaches to address this issue. First, we track the trajectory of the solution as generated by the optimizer and generate ranking questions that are presented to the designer to verify the correctness of the utility function, and second we propose backtracking rules if a local utility function is very different from the initially assessed function. We demonstrate our methodology using a mathematical example and a welded-beam design problem.},

abstract = {In the past year, as part of the Administration's thrust to promote Advanced Manufacturing, a solicitation was issued for the establishment of a Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation (DMDI) Institute. The DMDI Institute will be part of the U.S. Administration's National Network for Manufacturing Innovation (NNMI) initiative. The NNMI initiative is a Federal response to the need for an integrated, well-funded national network of large-scale, industry-led manufacturing innovation centers. Since global competitiveness is driven by the speed at which products can enter the marketplace at a competitive price point, this institute's focus will be on enterprise-wide utilization of the digital thread, enabling highly integrated manufacturing and design of complex products at reduced cost and time. It was stated that responses should clearly link a technology area with a specific concept of how that technology can impact that marketplace. The objective is to take the Department of Defense(DoD)Technology Readiness Level (TRL) from 4 to 7. This paper will illustrate a systems approach for DMDI based on establishing a Virtual Stochastic Lifecycle Design Environment (VSLDE) which could support the product development of complex systems, such as the new Army/DoD Future Vertical Lift (FVL) program, which will be used as an example.},

@article{Agalgaonkar2006,
abstract = {Many developing countries have emphasis on distributed generation (DG) technology for their generation expansion planning. The planning considerations and judicious choice of attributes are dictated by prevailing conditions. The attributes considered are capital costs, energy not served per annum, and profits from injecting power into the grid at peak load, all of which are important for a developing country. The uncertain futures considered are three possible loading conditions, which can be low, medium and high. Different scenarios (plans) are generated by various combinations of configurations. DGs can be configured as stand-alone mode, hybrid operation, or micro-grid formation with or without grid connection. With the increased complexities in DG planning options along with the multiple attributes to be accounted, more sophisticated techniques other than conventional economic analysis are needed to arrive at correct decisions by decision makers. The analytical hierarchy process (AHP) is used for obtaining relative weights in an objective way. Further, the statistical method like interval-based multi-attribute decision making with tradeoff analysis is used for shortlisting the feasible plans and identifying the most appropriate plan. It is proposed to use the weights obtained from AHP for finding the performance efficiencies in data envelopment analysis (DEA) for evaluating the plans. A new composite utility function is proposed to resolve cases where performance efficiency is insufficient for evaluation in DEA application. The sample system is derived with reference to a rural electrification scheme in India. The assessment of plans is presented and discussed. The comparative strengths and weaknesses of the methods are reported on the basis of the results obtained.},

A number of key areas have been identified as important in helping to increase the number of appliances which may feasibly be repaired in the future. Of these, two key areas encompass the automation of repair of appliances, and the information requirements in order to achieve this.

abstract = {Ever since artifacts have been produced, improving them has been a common human activity. Improving an artifact refers to modifying it such that it will be either easier to produce, or easier to use, or easier to fix, or easier to maintain, and so on. In all of these cases, "easier" means fewer resources are required for those processes. While 'resources' is a general measure, which can ultimately be expressed by some measure of cost (such as time or money), we believe that at the core of many improvements is the notion of reduction of complexity, or in other words, simplification. This talk presents our research on performing design simplification using analogical reasoning.  We first define the simplification problem as the problem of reducing the complexity of an artefact from a given point of view. We propose that a point of view from which the complexity of an artefact can be measured consists of a context, an aspect and a measure. Next, we describe an approach to solving simplification problems by goal-directed analogical reasoning, as our implementation of this approach. Finally, we present some experimental results obtained with the system.  The research presented in this dissertation is significant as it focuses on the intersection of a number of important, active research areas - analogical reasoning, functional representation, functional reasoning, simplification, and the general area of AI in Design.},

abstract = {Optimising performance of complex engineering artefacts, which are typically designed to have a useful life of several decades, becomes very difficult during in-service if lessons learnt are not used properly. The authors argue that performance of long-lived complex artefacts can be improved if adequate product in-service data is fed back to the early stages of the product life cycle. This paper discusses an inclusive life cycle approach to optimising product performance by using knowledge and experience gained during in-service. The problem is presented alongside a review of literature of relevant subject areas. A framework for in-service knowledge management is then presented and operationalised through an industrial case study. The framework is developed from the point of view of an integrated product and service provider. The findings from the case study demonstrate how in-service knowledge can be captured, fed back and reused for the design and manufacture stages of the product lifecycle. This enables designers to learn from in-service product performance by informing subsequent designs with in-service knowledge, and consequently improving the through-life product performance.},

@article{BarnardFeeney2015,
abstract = {The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) has just completed a major effort on a new standard ISO 10303-242 titled “Managed Model Based 3D Engineering.” It belongs to a family of standards called STEP (STandard for the Exchange of Product model data). ISO 10303-242 is also called the STEP Application Protocol 242 (STEP AP 242, for short). The intent of STEP AP 242 is to support a manufacturing enterprise with a range of standardized information models that flow through a long and wide “digital thread” that makes the manufacturing systems in the enterprise smart. One such standardized information model is that of tolerances specified on a product's geometry so that the product can be manufactured according to the specifications. This paper describes the attributes of smart manufacturing systems, the capabilities of STEP AP 242 in handling tolerance information associated with product geometry, and how these capabilities enable the manufacturing systems to be smart.},

abstract = {Computer-aided design (CAD) tools play a significant role in the modern product commercialization environment. As CAD and general CAx technology advances, it becomes more important to understand how engineers adapt their expertise to new environments and problems. This work examines a methodology consisting of a set of surveys, interviews, and exercises with a small group of practicing engineers to assess adaptive expertise (AE) and relate this AE to CAD modeling performance and procedures. Results detail AE survey results, a modeling and alteration exercise, and an exercise where engineers are asked to model a component using a CAD platform they are unfamiliar with. Interview and time use (from screen capture videos) results from this exercise are presented along with other data. Correlations among AE survey and interview variables and model analysis variables are presented. The epistemology dimension of the AE survey was found to be negatively correlated with both original modeling and alteration time. Overall modeling time in the different platform was positively correlated with the percentage of time a participant spent engaging in trial and error; modeling time in the different platform was negatively correlated with percentage of time spent doing actual modeling and the time spent thinking.

abstract = {Life cycle costing (LCC) is a method of analysis deployed by facility owners tasked with maintaining large infrastructure systems such as highways, hospitals, and subway systems; however its application to the design development process is fraught with a myriad of assumptions. Assumptions affecting the cost of future repairs can greatly impact the initial design decisions and enhanced methods are needed to evaluate future cash flows, judge the accuracy of future cost projections, and ascertain the schedule (When) these repairs may be needed in the future. By expanding the LCC evaluation process to include risk analysis, future costs can be analyzed using standard present worth analysis, and probabilistic ranges over the facility life. More robust decision making will enhance comparisons between design alternatives with improved accuracy in calculating the total cost of ownership and improved projections for the scheduling of the required maintenance events. Armed with improved information concerning life cycle cost, owners can balance initial and future cost to optimize designs, improve the value of their programs, and support their design decisions with defensible cost analysis leading to a higher probability of net value improvement and ultimate value alternative implementation.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2017 by ASME.The manufacturing industry is evolving and starting to use three-dimensional (3D) models as the central knowledge artifact for product data and product definition, or what is known as model-based definition (MBD). The model-based enterprise (MBE) uses MBD as a way to transition away from using traditional paper-based drawings and documentation. As MBD grows in popularity, it is imperative to understand what information is needed in the transition from drawings to models so that the models represent all the relevant information needed for processes to continue efficiently. Finding this information can help to define what data are common amongst different models in different stages of the lifecycle, which could help to establish a common information model. The common information model is a source that contains common information from domain specific elements amongst different aspects of the lifecycle. To help establish this common information model, information about how models are used in the industry within different workflows needs to be understood. To retrieve this information, a survey mechanism was administered to industry professionals from various sectors. Based on the results of the survey a common information model could not be established. However, the results gave great insight that will help in further investigation of the common information model.},

abstract = {This paper presents an integration-based solution for developing a real-time collaborative design (co-design) platform on heterogeneous computer-aided design (CAD) systems. Different from the visualization-based approaches, the product models are allowed to be constructed and modified from various sites together in the proposed collaborative design platform. Our approach is based on a mechanism for the translation between system modeling operations (SMOs) and neutral modeling commands (NMCs). Every operation given by a user on one site is translated into a NMC and transmitted to all the other sites through the network, and then the received NMC is converted into corresponding SMOs on every other site, instantaneously. Since only the commands but not the product data are transferred, the data size under transmission is greatly reduced, so that a real-time synchronization can be achieved with a standard network bandwidth. In addition, by developing system-dependent SMO↔NMC translators on different client CAD systems, users on different sites could join the collaboration by using their familiar CAD systems; this is the benefit that cannot be offered by the homogeneous co-design systems. The prototype implementation proves that our approach works well for integrating various current popular commercial CAD systems into a real-time collaborative design platform.},

abstract = {Control chart pattern recognition (CCPR) is an important issue in statistical process control because unnatural control chart patterns (CCPs) exhibited on control charts can be associated with specific causes that adversely affect the manufacturing processes. In recent years, many machine learning techniques [e.g., artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector machines (SVMs)] have been successfully applied to CCPR. However, such existing research for CCPR has mostly been developed for identification of basic CCPs. Little attention has been given to the utilization of ANNs/SVMs for identification of concurrent CCPs (two or more basic CCPs occurring simultaneously) which are commonly encountered in practical manufacturing processes. In addition, these existing research for CCPR cannot provide more detailed CCP parameter information, such as shift magnitude, trend slope, cycle amplitude, etc., which is very useful for quality practitioners to search the assignable causes that give rise to the out-of-control situation. This study proposes a hybrid approach that integrates extreme-point symmetric mode decomposition (ESMD) with extreme learning machine (ELM) to identify typical concurrent CCPs and in addition to accurately quantify the major CCP parameter of the specific basic CCPs involved. The numerical results indicate that the proposed model can effectively identify not only concurrent CCPs but also basic CCPs. Meanwhile, the major CCP parameter of the identified concurrent CCP can also be accurately quantified. 2014 Elsevier B.V.},

abstract = {Almost all current feature modelling systems are parametric, history-based modelling systems. These systems suffer from a number of shortcomings with regard to the modelling process. In particular, they lack a complete specification of feature semantics, and therefore fail to maintain the meaning of the features during modelling. Also, modelling operations sometimes are hampered by the model history, and occasionally even have ill-defined semantics. In the semantic feature modelling approach presented here, the semantics of features is well defined and maintained during all modelling operations. The result of these operations is independent of the order of feature creation, and is well defined. The specification of feature classes, the structure and functionality of the feature model, in particular the Cellular Model, and the model validity maintenance scheme are described. The advantages and disadvantages of the approach, compared to current feature modelling approaches, are pointed out.},

abstract = {The need for capturing knowledge in the digital form in design, process planning, production, and inspection has increasingly become an issue in manufacturing industries as the variety and complexity of product lifecycle applications increase. Both knowledge and data need to be well managed for quality assurance, lifecycle impact assessment, and design improvement. Some technical barriers exist today that inhibit industry from fully utilizing design, planning, processing, and inspection knowledge. The primary barrier is a lack of a well-accepted mechanism that enables users to integrate data and knowledge. This paper prescribes knowledge management to address a lack of mechanisms for integrating, sharing, and updating domain-specific knowledge in smart manufacturing (SM). Aspects of the knowledge constructs include conceptual design, detailed design, process planning, material property, production, and inspection. The main contribution of this paper is to provide a methodology on what knowledge manufacturing organizations access, update, and archive in the context of SM. The case study in this paper provides some example knowledge objects to enable SM.},

Gremlin, as a graph traversal machine, is composed of three interacting components: a graph {\$}G{\$}, a traversal {\$}\backslashPsi{\$}, and a set of traversers {\$}T{\$}. The traversers move about the graph according to the instructions specified in the traversal, where the result of the computation is the ultimate locations of all halted traversers. A Gremlin machine can be executed over any supporting graph computing system such as an OLTP graph database and/or an OLAP graph processor. Gremlin, as a graph traversal language, is a functional language implemented in the user's native programming language and is used to define the {\$}\backslashPsi{\$} of a Gremlin machine. This article provides a mathematical description of Gremlin and details its automaton and functional properties. These properties enable Gremlin to naturally support imperative and declarative querying, host language agnosticism, user-defined domain specific languages, an extensible compiler/optimizer, single- and multi-machine execution models, hybrid depth- and breadth-first evaluation, as well as the existence of a Universal Gremlin Machine and its respective entailments.},

abstract = {Engineering design is increasingly recognized as a decision-making process. This recognition brings with it the richness of many well-developed theories and methods from economics, operations research, decision sciences, and other disciplines. Done correctly, it forces the process of engineering design into a total systems context, and demands that design decisions account for a product's total life cycle. It also provides a theory of design that is based on a rigorous set of axioms that underlie value theory. But the rigor of decision-based design also places stringent conditions on the process of engineering design that eliminate popular approaches such as Quality Function Deployment. This paper presents the underlying notions of decision-based design, points to so,ne of the axioms that underlie the theory of decision-based design, and discusses the consequences of rite theory on engineering education.},

Value innovation places equal emphasis on value and innovation, since innovation without value can be too strategic or wild, too technology-driven or futuristic. To value innovate, managers must ask two questions: 1. Is the firm offering customers radically superior value? 2. Is the firm's price level accessible to the mass of buyers in the target market? Five key questions contrasting conventional competition-based logic with that of value innovation are presented and the type of organization that best unlocks employees' ideas and creativity is described.},

Romer /1990.
It is worth noting that both Arrow and Romer limited their discussions of nonrival and nonexcludable goods to technological innovations as is the tradition of economics. When the concept of innovation is redefined as value innovation, which is more relevant at the microeconomic firm level, the importance of the nonrival and nonexcludable notion is even more striking. This is because technological innovation often has a greater excludable component due to the possibility and relative ease of obtaining patent protection.
* 20. For a brilliant discussion of this issue, see: L.C. Thurow, "Needed: A New System of Intellectual Property Rights," Harvard Business Review, volume 75, September-October 1997, pp. 94-103.
* 21. The extent to which the idea behind a value innovation is nonexcludable affects the strategic price set by the value innovator. As we have argued, while innovative ideas and processes are usually nonexcludable or only partially so, some value innovators have patentable ideas that are excludable for a given time. In these cases, value innovators may be inclined to price their product the same or higher than rivals' products and services. However, recognizing the powerful economies of scale, learning, and increasing returns that come with high volumes of knowledge-intensive goods, the strategic price will still be set from the outset with an aim to capture the mass of buyers. In the United Kingdom, Dyson Appliances, for example, created a value innovation in vacuum cleaners with its launch of the Dyson Dual Cyclone, which eliminated vacuum cleaner bags and the hassle of replacing bags for the life of the vacuum. In doing so, Dyson also increased the suction power of its vacuum cleaner dramatically over the industry average. Given the radically superior value of its product and the fact that its value innovation was patentable, Dyson strategically set
its price relatively high while still capturing the mass of buyers. Although the vacuum cleaner was priced higher than the competition, it was a leap in value and within the economic reach of the mass of buyers. In this instance, Dyson did not use the conventional monopolist's practice of restricting supply by establishing a high price.

TM. Amabile, "A Model of Creativity and Innovation in Organizations," in Research in Organizational Behavior (Greenwich, Connecticut: JAI Press, 1988), PP.123-167.
27. This is consistent with the work of Amabile )1988), who argues that the most important elements of motivating innovation are concise and compelling articulation of the value of innovation, orientation away from the status quo, and activating an offensive leadership strategy aimed at the future, rather than simply trying to protect an organization's past.

abstract = {Design chain management requires many decision makers throughout the product development process. It is critical to reduce complexity and uncertainty of the design process by correctly modeling subjective data associated with decision makers' preferences. This paper aims at using decision support to find optimal designs by modeling respondent preferences and trade-offs with consideration of uncertainty. Specifically, a simulation-based ranking methodology is implemented and incorporated with traditional conjoint analysis. This process facilitates a schematic decision support process by alleviating user fatigue. In addition, incorporation of uncertainty in the ranking process provides the capability of producing robust and reliable products. The efficacy and applicability of simulation-based conjoint ranking is demonstrated with a case study of a power-generating shock absorber design. 2011 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {Rules and ontologies play a key role in the layered architecture of the Semantic Web, as they are used to ascribe meaning to, and to reason about, data on the Web. While the Ontology Layer of the Semantic Web is quite developed, and the Web Ontology Language (OWL) is a W3C recommendation since a couple of years already, the rules layer is far less developed and an active area of research; a number of initiatives and proposals have been made so far, but no standard as been released yet. Many implementations of rule engines are around which deal with Semantic Web data in one or another way. This article gives a comprehensive, although not exhaustive, overview of such systems, describes their supported languages, and sets them in relation with theoretical approaches for combining rules and ontologies as foreseen in the Semantic Web architecture. In the course of this, we identify desired properties and common features of rule languages and evaluate existing systems against their support. Furthermore, we review technical problems underlying the integration of rules and ontologies, and classify representative proposals for theoretical integration approaches into different categories.},

A system dynamics simulation model is built to understand some of the structural sources of cycles in the key housing market variables, from the perspective of construction companies. The model focuses on the economic balance dynamics between supply and demand. Because of the unavoidable delays in the perception of the real estate market conditions and construction of new buildings, prices and related market variables exhibit strong oscillations. Two policies are tested to reduce the oscillations: decreasing the construction time, and taking into account the houses under construction in starting new projects. Both policies yield significantly reduced oscillations, more stable behaviors.},

These uncertainty factors include price uncertainties, demand fluctuation and uncertain product life cycle. The objective of this research is to develop an efficient algorithm that generates capacity portfolio policies robust to aforementioned uncertainties. We model this capacity portfolio planning problem using Markov decision processes (MDP). In this MDP model, we consider two generation of manufacturing technology. The new generation capacity serves as a flexible resource that can be used to downward fulfill the deficiency of old generation capacity. The objective of this MDP model is to maximize the expected profit under uncertainties. An efficient algorithm is proposed to solve the problem and provide an optimal capacity expansion policy for both types of capacity. Moreover, we show that the optimal capacity expansion policy can be characterized by a monotone structure. We verify our results by detail simulation study.},

abstract = {Recent developments in information technology are influencing the field of engineering informatics in some profound ways. Nowhere is the influence more evident than in the use of Internet-based technologies and standards to share engineering and business information across a worldwide enterprise. In turn, the business need for collaboration among various players and partners in a globally integrated enterprise is driving the development and deployment of open standards, service-oriented architecture, and middleware. The convergence of these developments has provided us an opportunity to architect and implement a product information sharing service described in this paper. The architecture is service oriented and is based on the Object Management Group's PLM Services 1.0 specifications. It is implemented using IBM's WebSphere Process Server middleware and PROSTEP's OpenPDM software. This product information sharing service is one of the first industrial examples of a successful application of service-oriented architecture to product lifecycle management.},

@article{Ameri2008,
abstract = {In this paper, two measures are proposed for valuation of size and coupling complexities of design products as abstracted by three distinct representations. The proposed size complexity measure is based on the information theoretic definition of complexity that connects the complexity of a design to the level of entropy, or uncertainty, inherent in the design product. The proposed coupling complexity measure evaluates the decomposability of the graph-based representation of design products. To validate the proposed measures, an experiment is conducted to calculate the complexities of three consumer products based on three product representations, namely, function structure, connectivity graph, and parametric associativity graph. The findings indicate that coupling and size are independent measures of a product's complexity. Thus, it is recommended that both measures should be used. Further, the complexity of a product is not independent of the choice of representation model used to describe the product. This suggests that the complexity of a product will vary with the selected view. Finally, it is shown that the two approaches for measuring complexity of a product are generalizable and can be applied to different representations.},

The key focus is on new technology paradigms that can improve the competitiveness of American manufacturing - with a focus on small and medium enterprises (SMEs) - through digitization of design and manufacturing, democratization of technology, and collaborative design and analytics to sustain leadership across the U.S. manufacturing ecosystem. Funded through the newly established Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation Institute and supported through a Cooperative Agreement with the Department of Defense, the Digital Manufacturing Commons ( DMC) is an open-source platform based on previous Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and General Electric (GE) projects and built to democratize development and access to the tools for manufacturing innovation across small and large companies, universities, institutes, and entrepreneurs. The DMC will bring together one hundred thousand or more users, thousands of SMEs, large manufacturing companies, and universities to collaborate on manufacturing and to accelerate technologies that integrate the digital thread from design to manufacture and service. The initiative to build the DMC is led by GE Global Research Center. The DMC will be transitioned to the Digital Manufacturing and Design Innovation Institute and made available to the U.S. manufacturing base to enable a digital revolution in manufacturing innovation.},

abstract = {Ubiquitous sensing enabled by Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) technologies cuts across many areas of modern day living. This offers the ability to measure, infer and understand environmental indicators, from delicate ecologies and natural resources to urban environments. The proliferation of these devices in a communicating–actuating network creates the Internet of Things (IoT), wherein sensors and actuators blend seamlessly with the environment around us, and the information is shared across platforms in order to develop a common operating picture (COP). Fueled by the recent adaptation of a variety of enabling wireless technologies such as RFID tags and embedded sensor and actuator nodes, the IoT has stepped out of its infancy and is the next revolutionary technology in transforming the Internet into a fully integrated Future Internet. As we move from www (static pages web) to web2 (social networking web) to web3 (ubiquitous computing web), the need for data-on-demand using sophisticated intuitive queries increases significantly. This paper presents a Cloud centric vision for worldwide implementation of Internet of Things. The key enabling technologies and application domains that are likely to drive IoT research in the near future are discussed. A Cloud implementation using Aneka, which is based on interaction of private and public Clouds is presented. We conclude our IoT vision by expanding on the need for convergence of WSN, the Internet and distributed computing directed at technological research community.},

It is found that implementation of DFA at the early conceptual stage of design has led to enormous benefits including simplification of products, lower assembly and manufacturing costs, reduced overheads, improved quality and reduced time to market. DFA is now being broadened to include consideration of the difficulty of manufacture of the individual parts to be assembled and is providing the necessary basis for teamwork and simultaneous engineering. More recently, environmental concerns are requiring that disassembly for service and recycling be considered during product design - in fact, total life cycle costs for a product are becoming an essential part of simultaneous engineering. This keynote paper concludes with a discussion of current developments of design for disassembly (DFD).},

abstract = {Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to provide practitioners and students a practical yet comprehensive set of templates for applying Michael Porter's five forces framework for industry analysis. Design/methodology/approach – Based on experiences with practicing managers, small business owners, industry analysts, academics, and students, a set of industry analysis templates that systematically guides an analyst through a comprehensive assessment of the five forces is presented with the following: copies of the templates themselves, descriptions of their structure and use, an example of a completed template (spectator sports industry), and a discussion of possible modifications and extensions. Findings – The industry analysis templates described in this paper retain the comprehensiveness of Porter's framework but in a format much more student/manager-oriented using graphics, visual cues, a uniform structure, and straightforward descriptions of concepts. Template users show evidence of deeper strategic insights and have a sophisticated tool for future analysis. Practical implications – Managers, analysts, students, and others wanting robust industry analysis are provided with a comprehensive, structured, and practical set of templates to use in assessing an industry using the five forces framework. Originality/value – Leading strategic management texts and other sources provide no comprehensive, systematic, and robust format for conducting a five forces analysis of an industry. The set of industry analysis templates described in this paper provides a visually compelling, user-friendly format that can assist those analyzing industries gain important strategic insights not only into industry drivers, but also important competitive advantages for individual firms.

There is an important question that would need to be looked into: “How to define a coherent expression of Geometrical Product Specification during the tolerancing process along life cycle?”. There is a necessity for developing a complete answer representing standard tolerance practices. This paper proposes a model to allow a complete and coherent tolerancing process. The description of GeoSpelling, the model proposed to ISO for rebuilding standards in the fields of tolerancing and metrology, allows a unified description of geometrical specification. This model takes into account, not only the specification on isolated parts, but also on assemblies with the integration of the quantifier concept.},

@article{Lee1997,
abstract = {Dimensional inspection is commonly used to scrutinize the quality of manufactured products against the established standards and specifications. Meanwhile, dimensional measurement of an artifact is also commonly used as one of the methods for machine-performance calibration. However, the quality and reliability of many inspection and measurement processes are often contaminated by various uncertainties. Two prominent sources for measurement uncertainties are: (a) the imperfection of a measuring device, and (b) the dimensional deviation and geometric characteristics of a measured feature. Usually, the effects of both types of uncertainty are compounded by one another. To ensure the quality and reliability of any inspection process, measurement uncertainty needs to be addressed for all data acquisition activities. A method is also needed to identify and decouple the effect of compounded uncertainties. If this can be done, then the data collected can be properly adjusted and a more meaningful analysis result can be drawn. In this paper, the issues of uncertainty identification for machine calibration and dimension measurement using artifacts with various geometric features are discussed. Analytical models are derived first to identify and then decouple the compounded effect of both types of uncertainties. Finally, case studies are used to illustrate the procedures for both identifying and decoupling the compounded effect of the measurement uncertainties.},

@article{Chiesa2011,
abstract = {Commercialization is known to be a critical stage of the technological innovation process, mainly because of the high risks and costs that it entails. Despite this, many scholars consider it to be often the least well managed phase of the entire innovation process, and there is ample empirical evidence corroborating this belief. In high-tech markets, the difficulties encountered by firms in commercializing technological innovation are exacerbated by the volatility, interconnectedness, and proliferation of new technologies that characterize such markets. This is clearly evinced by the abundance of new high-tech products that fail on the market chiefly due to poor commercialization. Yet there is no clear understanding, in management theory and practice, of how commercialization decisions influence the market failure of new high-tech products. Drawing on research in innovation management, diffusion of innovation, and marketing, this article shows how commercialization decisions can influence consumer acceptance of a new high-tech product in two major ways: (i) by affecting the extent to which the players in the innovation's adoption network support the new product; (ii) by affecting the post-purchase attitude early adopters develop toward the innovation, and hence the type of word-of-mouth (positive or negative) they disseminate among later adopters. Lack of support from the adoption network is found to be an especially critical cause of failure for systemic innovations, while a negative post-purchase attitude of early adopters is a more significant determinant of market failure for radical innovations. There follows a historical analysis of eight innovations launched on consumer high-tech markets (Apple Newton, IBM PC-Junior, Tom Tom GO, Sony Walkman, 3DO Interactive Multiplayer, Sony MiniDisc, Palm Pilot, and Nintendo NES), which illustrates how commercialization decisions (i.e., timing, targeting and positioning, inter-firm relationships, product configuration, distribution, advertising, and pricing) can determine lack of support from the innovation's adoption network and a negative post-purchase attitude of early adopters. The results of this work provide useful insights for improving the commercialization decisions of product and marketing managers operating in high-technology markets, helping them avoid errors that are precursors of market failure. It is also hoped the article will inform further research aimed at identifying, theoretically and empirically, other possible causes of poor customer acceptance in high-tech markets.},

@article{Wu2017,
abstract = {Manufacturers have faced an increasing need for the development of predictive models that predict mechanical failures and the remaining useful life (RUL) of manufacturing systems or components. Classical model-based or physics-based prognostics often require an in-depth physical understanding of the system of interest to develop closed-form mathematical models. However, prior knowledge of system behavior is not always available, especially for complex manufacturing systems and processes. To complement model-based prognostics, data-driven methods have been increasingly applied to machinery prognostics and maintenance management, transforming legacy manufacturing systems into smart manufacturing systems with artificial intelligence. While previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of data-driven methods, most of these prognostic methods are based on classical machine learning techniques, such as artificial neural networks (ANNs) and support vector regression (SVR). With the rapid advancement in artificial intelligence, various machine learning algorithms have been developed and widely applied in many engineering fields. The objective of this research is to introduce a random forests (RFs)-based prognostic method for tool wear prediction as well as compare the performance of RFs with feed-forward back propagation (FFBP) ANNs and SVR. Specifically, the performance of FFBP ANNs, SVR, and RFs are compared using an experimental data collected from 315 milling tests. Experimental results have shown that RFs can generate more accurate predictions than FFBP ANNs with a single hidden layer and SVR.},

@article{Lu2014,
abstract = {With increasingly constrained budgets, it is now becoming more desirable to get more information from each experiment and to have an intentional strategy for selecting designs for split-plot experiments that balance multiple competing objectives. Lu and Anderson-Cook (2014) developed a decision-making process for selecting an optimal split-plot design (SPD) for flexible objectives/criteria based on a Pareto front. The method allows exploration of all contending non-inferior choices with their trade-offs to enable an informed and justifiable decision based on understanding the potential impact of subjective aspects. This article considers a case study of a mixture-process experiment that seeks an SPD with a good balance of precise model coefficient estimates as measured by D-efficiency and low experimental cost, which is a function of both the time required to run the experiment as well as the financial cost. The D-efficiency is a function of the whole plot-to-subplot error variance ratio, a quantity that is typically not known a priori when the choice of a design must be made. The Pareto front approach is applied and graphical tools are used to quantify the trade-offs between criteria and robustness of design performance to different user-selected preferences for the criteria. A substantially different pattern of design performance robustness to the uncertainty of the specified variance ratio is demonstrated compared to non-mixture experiments.

abstract = {Formal representation of manufacturing capabilities is a critical requirement for autonomous deployment of agile supply chains in distributed environments. In this context, manufacturing ontologies play a key role by providing the required means for explicit knowledge representation. Manufacturing Service Description Language (MSDL) is an OWL (Web Ontology Language)-based ontology developed with the purpose of modelling manufacturing capability in a service-oriented framework. This paper presents the rule-based extension of MSDL that enhances the ontology semantically and enables advanced ontological reasoning. The particular focus of this paper is on analysing the reasoning and inference patterns used by human experts during the supplier discovery process and formally representing them, to the possible extent, using Semantic Web Rule Language (SWRL). Two categories of rules, namely, property inference and classification rules are introduced and implemented in this research. In order to capture the rules and evaluate the effects of the encoded rules on the performance of the MSDL search engine, an experimental approach is followed in this work. The obtained results support the hypothesis that semantic enrichment of the ontology through introducing semantic SWRL rules enhances the performance of the semantic search process. 2013 Taylor Francis.},

abstract = {Recent theory and research has highlighted the importance of domain-specific knowledge in allowing superior performance. Previous studies have shown that task characteristics affect decision making performance, yet few (if any) studies have varied task characteristics in the context of knowledge differences. In this study, two task characteristics (the labeling of alternatives and the structure of the decision) were identified and hypothesized to interact with decision-maker knowledge level in affecting information acquisition and decision accuracy. A computerized information board study using high and low knowledge individuals in the domain of basketball found that both task characteristics interacted with knowledge level to affect information acquisition and decision accuracy. High knowledge individuals were significantly more accurate than low knowledge individuals on well-structured decisions but not on ill-structured decisions. Further, high knowledge individuals reduced information search when decisions were well-structured and when alternatives were descriptively labeled, and acquired considerably more contextual information than low knowledge individuals across all conditions. On the other hand, low knowledge information acquisition appeared to be largely unaffected by decision structure or descriptive labeling. The discussion highlights the need to view superior performance as a complex function of existing knowledge, task demands and information search.},

abstract = {Sustainable product design has been considered as one of the most important practices for achieving sustainability. To improve the environmental performances of a product through product design, however, a firm often needs to deal with some difficult technical trade-offs between traditional and environmental attributes which require new design concepts and engineering specifications. In this paper, we propose a novel use of the two-stage network Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to evaluate sustainable product design performances. We conceptualize “design efficiency” as a key measurement of design performance in terms of how well multiple product specifications and attributes are combined in a product design that leads to lower environmental impacts or better environmental performances. A two-stage network DEA model is developed for sustainable design performance evaluation with an “industrial design module” and a “bio design module.” To demonstrate the applications of our DEA-based methodology, we use data of key engineering specifications, product attributes, and emissions performances in the vehicle emissions testing database published by the US EPA to evaluate the sustainable design performances of different automobile manufacturers. Our test results show that sustainable design does not need to mean compromise between traditional and environmental attributes. Through addressing the interrelatedness of subsystems in product design, a firm can find the most efficient way to combine product specifications and attributes which leads to lower environmental impacts or better environmental performances. This paper contributes to the existing literature by developing a new research framework for evaluating sustainable design performances as well as by proposing an innovative application of the two-stage network DEA for finding the most eco-efficient way to achieve better environmental performances through product design.},

However, in high-tech industry such as semiconductor manufacturing, many factors that are interrelated affect the yield of fabricated wafers. Engineers who rely on personal domain knowledge cannot find possible root causes of defects rapidly and effectively. This study aims to develop a framework for data mining and knowledge discovery from database that consists of a Kruskal–Wallis test, K-means clustering, and the variance reduction splitting criterion to investigate the huge amount of semiconductor manufacturing data and infer possible causes of faults and manufacturing process variations. The extracted information and knowledge is helpful to engineers as a basis for trouble shooting and defect diagnosis. We validated this approach with an empirical study in a semiconductor foundry company in Taiwan and the results demonstrated the practical viability of this approach.},

Predictive analytics (using advanced machine learning) is particularly valuable in manufacturing, as it leads to production improvement with respect to the cost, quantity, quality and sustainability of manufactured products by anticipating changes to the manufacturing system states. Many small and medium manufacturers do not have the infrastructure, technical capability or financial means to take advantage of predictive analytics. A domain-specific language and framework for performing predictive analytics for manufacturing and production frameworks can counter this deficiency. In this paper, we survey some of the applications of predictive analytics in manufacturing and we discuss the challenges that need to be addressed. Then, we propose a core set of abstractions and a domain-specific framework for applying predictive analytics on manufacturing applications. Such a framework will allow manufacturers to take advantage of predictive analytics to improve their production.},

abstract = {The latest solutions for shop-floor data collection and analysis come from enterprise resource planning (ERP) software developers and from shop-floor data collection and analysis specialists. Some newer features include systems that are optimized for use with increasingly popular hand-held mobile devices, smartphones and tablet computers. "The most important point is to convert the volume of manufacturing shop-floor data into actionable information," states Jim Abbassian, president, Predator Software (Portland, OR). "For example, say at a given machine a Machine Alarm happens at 11:05 pm and when you get that data, you know that the current critical part number has stopped producing at a bottleneck workcenter for a Tier 1 customer where there is no scheduled third shift. This is actionable information that can make a real-world difference." Machine Monitoring Mandatory for Lean Real-time data collection and monitoring of machine tools for measuring OEE metrics is essential for successful lean manufacturing efforts and critical shop-floor processes, many observers note. Yet in spite of this need for critical data analysis , a large percentage of shops simply don't have machine monitoring, notes David Edstrom, president and chairman of MTConnect Institute (McLean, VA). Edstrom, who recently gave a talk on shop-floor networking and communication and the MTConnect protocol at the DMG / Mori Seiki (Hoffman Estates, IL) Innovation Days, says that only about 4-5{\%} of machine tools are monitored today.

abstract = {Renewable energy sources are amongst the more widely acceptable options for the future transformations of existing energy systems. The complexities of such transformations call for various comprehensive preparatory actions. Amongst them, the organisation of a multifaceted renewable value-chain into a renewable network may well be crucial for the successful utilisation of renewable energy sources in the future. This paper proposes a novel concept for renewable network covering entire renewable value chain with division on supply, demand and technology sections. In the past, each section has been addressed separately. The organisation of renewable network covering all sections is deemed to be vital for accomplishing the optimal distribution and deployment of renewable energy sources. Constant technological advancements within the renewable sector indicate the significance of a technology section within a renewable network. The appropriate arrangement of various stakeholders involved throughout the entire value-chain, which includes all sections of a renewable network, is therefore crucial for the further development of a renewable sector. The proposed concept of a renewable network would support the effective operation of a renewable value-chain within a municipality through the establishment of local virtual energy cooperatives aimed at fulfilling energy needs and supporting the development of the community. The applicability of the proposed concept is demonstrated through the development of a biomass network within the municipality of Cirkulane, Slovenia.},

abstract = {In the modern manufacturing context, CAD/CAM and CNC solutions are normally provided by different vendors, which gives rise to a heterogeneous application environment. Despite many integration approaches developed in the last decades, software integration and product data exchange are still challenging issues that need to be addressed. In this article, a collaborative product data exchange mechanism is proposed for a Distributed Interoperable Manufacturing Platform (DIMP). In this platform, STEP (ISO 10303) and STEP-NC (ISO 14649) data models are utilised to support the data flow. A novel data exchange mechanism is developed to provide the right amount and right level of product data subset to the users based on these models. This mechanism enables the users to work with a reasonable scope of product data, without interfering others. To realise this concept, data-extracting algorisms are developed to provide a customised data domain, and meta-data model compliant with STEP is proposed to guarantee data tractability. Moreover, synchronisation is catered for after the data set is processed.},

abstract = {Smart manufacturing technologies require a cyber-physical infrastructure to collect and analyze data and information across the manufacturing enterprise. This paper describes a concept for a product lifecycle test bed built on a cyber-physical infrastructure that enables smart manufacturing research and development. The test bed consists of a Computer-Aided Technologies (CAx) Lab and a Manufacturing Lab that interface through the product model creating a “digital thread” of information across the product lifecycle. The proposed structure and architecture of the test bed is presented, which highlights the challenges and requirements of implementing a cyber-physical infrastructure for manufacturing. The novel integration of systems across the product lifecycle also helps identify the technologies and standards needed to enable interoperability between design, fabrication, and inspection. Potential research opportunities enabled by the test bed are also discussed, such as providing publicly accessible CAx and manufacturing reference data, virtual factory data, and a representative industrial environment for creating, prototyping, and validating smart manufacturing technologies.},

abstract = {As a reason for competitiveness, the process of product development evolves using, in some situations, improvement methods, e.g. design for manufacturing and assembly (DFMA). In the framework of the product development process, it is desirable that engineers and managers have a systemic view of the effects that changes in local processes will have on the overall performance of the entire production system. This vision of such effects can be achieved with computer simulation. This study aims at assessing how DFMA can be integrated with computer simulation and the benefits from the alternatives identified by such method during production and assembly. Using the electronic voting machine printer as object of study, options to improve design by means of DFMA principles are identified. Five models were developed to represent the current assembly process and two models following the implementation of the changes proposed by the DFMA. The sale price is confidential (exclusive product of the Brazilian government). The company provided data in assembly costs. The results show the production increase in assembly time (9.94{\%}) and average daily sales ({\$}415).},

abstract = {The drive to maximize the potential benefits of decision support systems continues to increase as industry is continually driven by the competitive needs of operating in dynamic global environments. The more extensive information support tools which are becoming available in the PLM world appear to have great potential but require a substantial overhead in their configuration. However, sharing information and knowledge in cross-disciplinary teams and across system and company boundaries is not straightforward and there is a clear need for more effective frameworks for information and knowledge sharing if new product development processes are to have effective ICT support. This paper presents a view of the current status of manufacturing information sharing using light-weight ontologies and goes on to discuss the potential for heavyweight ontological engineering approaches such as the Process Specification Language (PSL). It explains why such languages are needed and how they provide an important step towards process knowledge sharing. Machining examples are used to illustrate how PSL provides a rigorous basis for process knowledge sharing and subsequently to illustrate the value of linking foundation and domain ontologies to provide a basis for multi-context knowledge sharing.},

abstract = {This paper identifies the need for a verification methodology for manufacturing knowledge in design support systems; and proposes a suitable methodology based on the concept of ontological commitment and the PSL ontology (ISO/CD18629). The use of the verification procedures within an overall system development methodology is examined, and an understanding of how various categories of manufacturing knowledge (typical to design support systems) map onto the PSL ontology is developed. This work is also supported by case study material from industrial situations, including the casting and machining of metallic components. The PSL ontology was found to support the verification of most categories of manufacturing knowledge, and was shown to be particularly suited to process planning representations. Additional concepts and verification procedures were however needed to verify relationships between products and manufacturing processes. Suitable representational concepts and verification procedures were therefore developed, and integrated into the proposed knowledge verification methodology.},

abstract = {The increasing growth of digital technologies in manufacturing has provided industry with opportunities to improve its productivity and operations. One such opportunity is the digital thread, which links product lifecycle systems so that shared data may be used to improve design and manufacturing processes. The development of the digital thread has been challenged by the inherent difficulty of aggregating and applying context to data from heterogeneous systems across the product lifecycle. This paper presents a reference four-tiered architecture designed to manage the data generated by manufacturing systems for the digital thread. The architecture provides segregated access to internal and external clients, which protects intellectual property and other sensitive information, and enables the fusion of manufacturing and other product lifecycle data. We have implemented the architecture with a contract manufacturer and used it to generate knowledge and identify performance improvement opportunities that would otherwise be unobservable to a manufacturing decision maker.},

abstract = {Interoperability between shop floor devices and upper layer systems is a key challenge for enabling Internet of Things in industrial applications. Standardized protocols such as IPv6, CoAP, and XML can be used to address this issue. Widely used XML-based technologies such as SenML, EEML, OPC-UA as well as others rely on XML to be able to support a wide range of sensor and actuator applications. However, this approach results in high communication overhead due to the verbose nature of plain text messages encoded in XML. When devices are communicating using 6LoWPAN over IEEE 802.15.4, it is important to keep the messages small enough to fit into one MAC-layer frame to avoid fragmentation and hence conserving bandwidth and transmission energy. One possible solution is to integrate differential binary delta-encoding with a service-based framework based on CoAP, SenML and EXI. The proposed efficient communication approach for service-based architecture can compress a series of events up to 90-95{\%}. The proposed framework is a holistic approach for enabling distributed monitoring and control applications and a move towards realizing the vision of Services of Things.},

abstract = {Collaborative e-engineering requires different digital tools in different phases of the product development process. However, an interoperability error makes product model data unusable when applying digital tools. Movement toward concurrent and collaborative e-engineering drives the need for assuring the quality of the communicated product model data. In this paper, a quality diagnosis method of the shape data of a neutral file based on a product model including curved surface described in formal language is proposed. The proposed method is based on the standard for the exchange of product data (STEP) technology using EXPRESS-X, which is the mapping language between STEP model data. In order to help create the data quality diagnostics criteria for geometric errors easily, the classification of the quality criteria based on their geometric algorithms is also proposed. The certification data model of the product data is proposed to avoid a tedious checking procedure in the receiver system. Some of the quality criteria, which were published by the Strategic Automotive Product Data Standards Industry Group (SASIG), are rewritten in formal language and applied to the data sets including the error set provided by the Japan Autornotive Manufacturers Association (JAMA) to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed diagnostics method. The approach based on the formal language is extensible for any phase of the product development process by rewriting the criteria. Not all SASIG criteria have actually been implemented. Future work is to rewrite all SASIG-PDQ criteria into EXPRESS-X schemas. (c) 2006 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Smart manufacturing promises to provide significant increases in productivity and effectiveness of manufacturing systems by better connecting the data from people, processes, and things. However, there is no uniform, generalized method for deploying linked-data concepts to the manufacturing domain. The literature describes and commercial vendors offer centralized data-repository solutions, but these types of approaches quickly breakdown under the intense burden of managing and reconciling all the data flowing in and out of the various repositories across the product lifecycle. In this paper, we introduce a method for linking and tracing data throughout the product lifecycle using graphs to form digital threads. We describe a prototype implementation of the method and a case study to demonstrate an information round-trip for a product assembly between the design, manufacturing, and quality domains of the product lifecycle. The expected impact from this novel, standards-based, linked-data method is the ability to use digital threads to provide data, system, and viewpoint interoperability in the deployment of smart manufacturing to realize industry's {\$}30 Billion annual opportunity.},

These methods optimize the entire system by simultaneously solving the control and operation problems. Their advantages have been demonstrated in comparison to the conventional sequential method, which solves the subproblems independently and neglects the interaction among the subproblems. We give an in-depth review of these integrated methods in terms of the integration scopes, model formulations, solution algorithms, and implementation strategies to address uncertainty. Though significant progress has been made, research on integrated methods is still in its infant stage. It is still mathematically challenging to solve a complex integrated problem composed of binary/logic variables from operation problems and nonlinear differential-algebraic equations inherited from control problems. We discuss some major challenges concerning complexity, heterogeneity, and uncertainty, and suggest a number of promising directions for future research.},

Equivalences are established to ordinary linear programming models for effecting computations.

abstract = {This paper addresses the economic benefits of selectively assigning a batch of subassemblies to each other after inspecting and correcting them as needed. Our work is based on optimizing the collective cost of subassembly inspection, rework, scrap, final assembly failure, and the act of subassembly mating. The expected value for the cost is estimated using Monte Carlo Simulation and optimized using a metaheuristic. After each simulation replication where we simulate a batch of subassemblies, we assign the inspected subassembly parts so that the rolled yield throughput is maximized. The complexity of this work is attributed to the fact that we solve an optimization problem for an objective that is estimated using simulation, and in each simulation replication there is another optimization problem to be solved for selective assembly. Significant improvements in assembly lines are predicted to be accomplished when this work is integrated in a real production environment. 2012 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {The early assessment of the performance of responsive manufacturing systems contributes significantly to achieving their potential effectiveness. In most manufacturing scenarios, the human involvement is considered one of the critical elements affecting the system performance. In reconfigurable manufacturing systems (RMSs), the workers' tasks are expected to change frequently as the system is reconfigured. The ability to predict the probability of errors caused by human involvement can provide the system designer with insights as to the required skill levels, training programmes, job design, tasks assignment, work organization as well as options for modifying the system design to achieve better quality results. A model for assessing the probability of human errors in RMSs, based on tasks characteristics, work environment, as well as workers capabilities has been developed using the multi-attribute utility analysis. Application of the model to an industrial case study demonstrated its ability to assess, early in the system design and development stage, the probability of errors resulting from human involvement. This is critical in investigating different improvement opportunities to achieve lower levels of errors owing to human involvement, and hence higher quality.},

@article{Thoben2017,
abstract = {A fourth industrial revolution is occurring in global manufacturing. It is based on the introduction of Internet of things and servitization concepts into manufacturing companies, leading to vertically and horizontally integrated production systems. The resulting smart factories are able to fulfill dynamic customer demands with high variability in small lot sizes while integrating human ingenuity and automation. To support the manufacturing industry in this conversion process and enhance global competitiveness, policy makers in several countries have established research and technology transfer schemes. Most prominently, Germany has enacted its Industrie 4.0 program , which is increasingly affecting European policy, while the United States focuses on smart manufacturing. Other industrial nations have established their own programs on smart manufacturing, notably Japan and Korea. This shows that manufacturing intelligence has become a crucial topic for researchers and industries worldwide. The main object of these activities are the so-called cyber-physical systems (CPS): physical entities (e.g., machines, vehicles, and work pieces), which are equipped with technologies such as RFIDs, sensors, microprocessors, telematics or complete embedded systems. They are characterized by being able to collect data of themselves and their environment , process and evaluate these data, connect and communicate with other systems, and initiate actions. In addition, CPS enabled new services that can replace traditional business models based solely on product sales. The objective of this paper is to provide an overview of the Industrie 4.0 and smart manufacturing programs, analyze the application potential of CPS starting from product design through production and logistics up to maintenance and exploitation (e.g., recycling), and identify current and future research issues. Besides the technological perspective, the paper also takes into account the economic side considering the new business strategies and models available.},

@phdthesis{Groth2007,
abstract = {The Oxford English Dictionary defines provenance as (i) the fact of coming from some particular source or quarter; origin, derivation. (ii) the history or pedigree of a work of art, manuscript, rare book, etc.; concr., a record of the ultimate derivation and passage of an item through its various owners. In art, knowing the provenance of an artwork lends weight and authority to it while providing a context for curators and the public to understand and appreciate the work's value. Without such a documented history, the work may be misunderstood, unappreciated, or undervalued. In computer systems, knowing the provenance of digital ob jects would provide them with greater weight, authority, and context just as it does for works of art. Specifically, if the prove- nance of digital ob jects could be determined, then users could understand how documents were produced, how simulation results were generated, and why decisions were made. Provenance is of particular importance in science, where experimental results are reused, reproduced, and verified. However, science is increasingly being done through large-scale collaborations that span multiple institutions, which makes the problem of determining the provenance of scientific results significantly harder. Current approaches to this problem are not designed specifically for multi-institutional scien- tific systems and their evolution towards greater dynamic and peer-to-peer topologies. Therefore, this thesis advocates a new approach, namely, that through the autonomous creation, scalable recording, and principled organisation of documentation of systems' processes, the determina- tion of the provenance of results produced by complex multi-institutional scientific systems is enabled. The dissertation makes four contributions to the state of the art. First is the idea that provenance is a query performed over documentation of a system's past process. Thus, the problem is one of how to collect and collate documentation from multiple distributed sources and organise it in a manner that enables the provenance of a digital ob ject to be determined. Second is an open, generic, shared, principled data model for documentation of processes, which enables its collation so that it provides high-quality evidence that a system's processes occurred. Once documentation has been created, it is recorded into specialised repositories called provenance stores using a formally specified protocol, which ensures documentation has high- quality characteristics. Furthermore, patterns and techniques are given to permit the distributed deployment of provenance stores. The protocol and patterns are the third contribution. The fourth contribution is a characterisation of the use of documentation of process to answer questions related to the provenance of digital ob jects and the impact recording has on application performance. Specifically, in the context of a bioinformatics case study, it is shown that six different provenance use cases are answered given an overhead of 13{\%} on experiment run- time. Beyond the case study, the solution has been applied to other applications including fault tolerance in service-oriented systems, aerospace engineering, and organ transplant management.},

abstract = {In a turbulent world, global competition and the uncertainty of markets have led organizations and technology to evolve exponentially, surpassing the most imaginary scenarios predicted at the beginning of the digital manufacturing era, in the 1980s. Business paradigms have changed from a standalone vision into complex and collaborative ecosystems where enterprises break down organizational barriers to improve synergies with others and become more competitive. In this context, paired with networking and enterprise integration, enterprise information systems (EIS) interoperability gained utmost importance, ensuring an increasing productivity and efficiency thanks to a promise of more automated information exchange in networked enterprises scenarios. However, EIS are also becoming more dynamic. Interfaces that are valid today are outdated tomorrow, thus static interoperability enablers and communication software services are no longer the solution for the future. This paper is focused on the challenge of sustaining networked EIS interoperability, and takes up input from solid research initiatives in the areas of knowledge management and model driven development, to propose and discuss several research strategies and technological trends towards next EIS generation.},

@article{Chang2010,
abstract = {There are many challenges associated with the design and realization of fast changing highly customized products. One promising approach is to implement design for manufacturing (DFM) strategies aimed at reducing production costs without compromising product quality. For manufacturers doing business in a globally distributed market place, effective reuse and sharing of the DFM knowledge in a collaborative environment is essential. In recent years, ontologies are increasingly used for knowledge management in engineering. Here, ontology is defined as a formal specification of domain knowledge that can be used to define a set of data and structure that enables experts to share information in a domain of interest, to aid information reasoning, and to manage and reuse data. The primary goal of this paper is to put forward the process of ontology development and utilization for DFM and to study the most important phases in the process, including: the concept categorization and class hierarchy development, slot categorization and development, identification and realization of relations among slots, and methods to support knowledge capture and reuse. Four cases are presented to illustrate the promising use of a DFM ontology. These cases prove that the DFM ontology and the process of ontology development and utilization for the DFM can facilitate the reuse of existing data, find the inconsistency and errors in data, reduce the work associated with populating the knowledge base of the ontology, and help designers make decisions by considering complex technical and economical criteria.},

abstract = {The Model-Based Enterprise (MBE) paradigm is being adopted by manufacturing companies in a variety of industries. Companies benefit from enhanced visualization, documentation, and communication capabilities when 3D annotated product definitions, or Model-Based Definitions (MBD) replace two-dimensional drawings throughout an enterprise. It is critical that product information, much of which is defined implicitly in drawings, is not lost in this transition. This presents a challenge to authors and translators of 3D models used through the product lifecycle. They must understand the semantics of the product information typically presented by a drawing then explicitly include this information, in a computer-interpretable form, in the MBD. The research study described in this paper seeks to discover what is the minimum set of required information to carry out all the tasks in a given workflow of a model-based enterprise. A survey was conducted across various industry sectors to identify the foundational elements of this Minimum Information Model (MIM) in selected workflows. This study identified the information used within the specific workflows, the capabilities of 3D CAD models to carry this information, and the implications for doing so.},

abstract = {The research presented herein is a first step toward integrating two emerging structural health management paradigms: digital twin and sensory materials. Digital twin is an emerging life management and certification paradigm whereby models and simulations consist of as-built vehicle state, as-experienced loads and environments, and other vehicle-specific history to enable high-fidelity modeling of individual aerospace vehicles throughout their service lives. The digital twin concept spans many disciplines, and an extensive study on the full domain is out of the scope of this study. Therefore, as it pertains to the digital twin, this research focused on one major concept: modeling specifically the as-manufactured geometry of a component and its microstructure (to the degree possible). The second aspect of this research was to develop the concept of sensory materials such that they can be employed within the digital twin framework. Sensory materials are shape-memory alloys that undergo an audible phase transformation while experiencing sufficient strain. Upon embedding sensory materials with a structural alloy, this audible transformation helps improve the reliability of crack detection especially at the early stages of crack growth. By combining these two early-stage technologies, an automated approach to evidence-based inspection and maintenance of aerospace vehicles is sought.},

The design engineer designs a part and sends the final design to the manufacturing engineer, who re-interprets the design and plans the manufacturing activities to produce the part. These two sections generally work in isolation from each other, resulting in high lead-time, duplication of data, inconsistent product data and sometimes redesign of a product. Feature recognition is a process of reinterpreting a design model database for automating downstream manufacturing activities. Active research in this field has developed numerous techniques such as syntactic pattern recognition, graph theory, volume decomposition, artificial intelligence and hint-based, and neural network-based systems.

In the second component, an artificial neural network model is developed to estimate the life percentile and failure times of roller bearings. This is then used to construct a marginal distribution. The third component consists of the construction of a cost matrix and probabilistic replacement model that optimizes the expected cost per unit time. Furthermore, the integrated system consists of a heuristic managerial decision rule for different scenarios of predictive and corrective cost compositions. Finally, the proposed system can be applied in various industries and different kinds of equipment that possess well-defined degradation characteristics},

abstract = {From a business perspective, cloud computing has revolutionized the information and communication technology (ICT) industry by offering scalable and on-demand ICT services as well as innovative pricing plans such as pay-per-use and subscription. Considering the economic benefits of cloud computing, cloud-based design and manufacturing (CBDM) has been proposed as a new paradigm in digital manufacturing and design innovation. Although CBDM has the potential to reduce costs associated with high performance computing (HPC) and maintaining ICT infrastructures in the context of cloud computing, it is challenging to justify the potential cost savings associated with design and manufacturing because of the complexity in the economic benefit analysis of migrating to CBDM. In response, this paper provides important insights into the economics of CBDM by identifying key cost factors and potential pricing models that can influence decision making on whether migrating to the cloud for computationally expensive analyses that are commonplace for design and manufacturing (e.g., computer-aided design (CAD)/computer-aided engineering (CAE)/computer-aided manufacturing (CAM)) is economically justifiable. This work, for the first time, identifies the key economic benefits required for a comparative study that supports organizations in determining when traditional in-house design and manufacturing versus CBDM is most appropriate. Several comparative case studies and a hypothetical application example are provided to demonstrate and quantitatively validate decision support methods. Finally, key issues and road blocks for CBDM are outlined.},

abstract = {Producibility improvement is a major challenge for design and manufacturing firms. For aircraft or car body, this improvement has to go through a better product assemblability. In order to reach this goal, effects of manufacturing variations have to be managed. Two questions are asked about variation reduction: how to control effect of variations on functional requirements and what product characteristics are most sensitive to variations. No global answers exist to these questions. Therefore, we propose to describe in this paper an industrial method. The main idea of this method is that geometrical variation flows belong to the assembly process. During the preliminary design, the first step of our method is to identify where are the Key Characteristics for the product. The second step of the method performs a qualitative product analysis in order to eliminate the worst assembly sequences. At last a quantitative analysis allows to select the most promising assembly sequences. This integrated method has been applied with success to aircraft assembly.},

This is especially true when impacted by the ill-defined consequences on the environment in an ever increasingly eco-conscious world. Analytical Hierarchy process (AHP) is one method of providing decision support, and is an instance of a decision support heuristic. Machine learning methods have proved themselves on many well defined problems with clearly defined objectives. In particular, we focus on the recently emerging field of hyper-heuristics which is a blend of human designed heuristics, with the extension of machine designed heuristics. In essence humans can operate at the higher concept or abstract level, while machine heuristics can operate at a lower level. There are a number of issues within the proposed framework, including visualizing a multi-dimensional surface of designs along the Pareto front, as well as dealing with different types of data during the decision making process. It is proposed that Hyper-heuristics, supplemented with other methodologies to deal with vague or missing data, offer a framework in which to begin to address several of the complex compromises that arise during product development.},

abstract = {In order to maximize assets, manufacturers should use real-time knowledge garnered from ongoing and continuous collection and evaluation of factory-floor machine status data. In discrete parts manufacturing, factory machine monitoring has been difficult, due primarily to closed, proprietary automation equipment that make integration difficult. Recently, there has been a push in applying the data acquisition concepts of MTConnect to the real-time acquisition of machine status data. MTConnect is an open, free specification aimed at overcoming the “Islands of Automation” dilemma on the shop floor. With automated asset analysis, manufacturers can improve production to become lean, efficient, and effective. The focus of this paper will be on the deployment of MTConnect to collect real-time machine status to automate asset management. In addition, we will leverage the ISO 22400 standard, which defines an asset and quantifies asset performance metrics. In conjunction with these goals, the deployment of MTConnect in a large aerospace manufacturing facility will be studied with emphasis on asset management and understanding the impact of machine Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) on manufacturing.},

abstract = {High-performance processes require a design that operates close to design boundaries and specifications, while still guaranteeing robust performance without design constraint violations. In order to safely approach tighter boundaries of process performance, much attention has been devoted to integrating design and control in which dynamic controllability, as well as the design decisions, are considered simultaneously. However, rigorous methods solving design and control simultaneously lead to challenging mathematical formulations that easily become intractable numerically and computationally. This paper introduces a new mathematical formulation to reduce this combinatorial complexity of integrating design and control. We will show that a substantial reduction in problem size can be achieved using embedded control decisions within specific designs. These embedded control decisions avoid a combinatorial explosion of control configuration, using a full state space model that does not require a pairing of control variables and loops. The current capabilities of the methodology will be demonstrated using a realistic reactor-column flowsheet. 2011 American Chemical Society.},

abstract = {State Analysis is a methodology developed over the last decade for architecting, designing and documenting complex control systems. Although it was originally conceived for designing robotic spacecraft, recent applications include the design of control systems for large ground-based telescopes. The European Southern Observatory (ESO) began a project to design the European Extremely Large Telescope (E-ELT), which will require coordinated control of over a thousand articulated mirror segments. The designers are using State Analysis as a methodology and the Systems Modeling Language (SysML) as a modeling and documentation language in this task. To effectively apply the State Analysis methodology in this context it became necessary to provide ontological definitions of the concepts and relations in State Analysis and greater flexibility through a mapping of State Analysis into a practical extension of SysML. The ontology provides the formal basis for verifying compliance with State Analysis semantics including architectural constraints. The SysML extension provides the practical basis for applying the State Analysis methodology with SysML tools. This paper will discuss the method used to develop these formalisms (the ontology), the formalisms themselves, the mapping to SysML and approach to using these formalisms to specify a control system and enforce architectural constraints in a SysML model.},

abstract = {An investigation into how the advent of Rapid Manufacturing will influence an individual designer's approach to product design and materials selection is detailed. The assumption is made that Rapid Prototyping machines have evolved into viable manufacturing systems and all associated problems with accuracy, surface finish and repeatability have been resolved. Without the restriction of removing a product from a tool, designers will be free to design any complexity of geometry that they either desire or require. This tool-less approach to manufacturing will have profound implications on the way designers are accustomed to working and will eliminate most Design for Manufacture considerations. Design investigations are presented to highlight the potential importance and scope of Rapid Manufacturing. With advances in a new range of materials, some Rapid Manufacturing is happening today?albeit with existing Rapid Prototyping equipment. However, to enable designers to use existing Rapid Prototyping equipment for manufacturing purposes, there is a need for comprehensive information relating to the mechanical properties of the available materials. This is required to enable ?Design for Rapid Manufacture?. The most comprehensive analysis to date of three new materials aimed for end-use part manufacture at differing ages, humidities and temperatures is presented.},

abstract = {In the communication and sharing of product data, if the difference of the required data quality and the data quality actually incorporated into data is significant, it causes various problems. It is often the case that a creator of low quality data does not realize it unless it is harmful for his job. In most cases, low quality data passed to subsequent processes, such as manufacturing process, cause problems since these are not appropriate from the machining precision point of view or the detailed shape modeling point of view. In these cases, rework or repair of data is necessitated before commencing the target process, which results in significant economy loss and delay of product development. Today's product model data are dumb data because design intents and data quality incorporated are not explicitly represented. Receiving systems cannot know whether the data passed possess sufficient quality for the target job or not. Another problem is that engineers in later processes, such as the manufacturing process, cannot issue data quality related request beforehand in a commonly agreed manner. The problems mentioned above are caused by the lack of a commonly agreed representation of product data quality (PDQ) information. Our proposed solution is designed to enable the communication and sharing of data quality information. This paper reports the development of a PDQ standard (ISO 10303-59), which is a resource part of ISO 10303 Standard for the Exchange of Product Model Data (STEP) (2008, “ISO 10303-59, Industrial Automation Systems and Integration. Product Data Representation and Exchange. Part 59 Integrated Generic Resource: Quality of Product Shape Data,” International Standard Organization, Geneva). The objective of ISO 10303-59 is to establish a PDQ model and to enable the use of PDQ data independently or in combination with product data. The developed PDQ information model represents concepts such as data quality criteria, measurement requirements, and measured results. Based on the PDQ model, the PDQ for shape data model, which is a specialization of the PDQ model to 3D shape data quality, is also developed.},

abstract = {Complexity metrics have been developed for multiple applications such as consumer products, software, trajectory selection and assembly systems. Although existing complexity metrics were developed to reduce product design and development costs, their lack of simplicity in formulation and robustness has limited their applicability. This paper proposes a standard methodology for comparing and evaluating these metrics and introduces dimensions of complexity that should be considered towards the goal of developing a generalizable product complexity measure. To this end, this paper introduces variables that integrate multiple facets of complexity into a single metric. A medical device case study is used to compare the efficiency and robustness of existing complexity measures. The medical device case study also serves as the motivation for the proposed complexity metric due to the complexity of the domain itself and the increasing importance of mitigating healthcare costs. Overall, product complexity metrics can aid medical device development by increasing the understanding about the design and its implications regarding development time and FDA approvals. 2012 by ASME.},

abstract = {Recently, "Big Data" has attracted not only researchers' but also manufacturers' attention along with the development of information technology. In this paper, the concept, characteristics, and applications of "Big Data" are briefly introduced first. Then, the various data involved in the three main phases of product lifecycle management (PLM) (i.e., beginning of life, middle of life, and end of life) are concluded and analyzed. But what is the relationship between these PLM data and the term "Big Data"? Whether the "Big Data" concept and techniques can be employed in manufacturing to enhance the intelligence and efficiency of design, production, and service process, and what are the potential applications? Therefore, in order to answer these questions, the existing applications of "Big Data" in PLM are summarized, and the potential applications of "Big Data" techniques in PLM are investigated and pointed out.},

abstract = {This paper shows how to combine ontological and model-based techniques in languages that facilitate collaborative design exploration. The proposed approach uses ontology to capture alternative designs and incremental refinements that meet requirements and earlier design commitments. Model-based techniques are applied to develop more powerful, engineering-friendly languages for using ontology. It uses ontology's open world semantics to support design collaboration with flexible and accurate design combination, refinement, and consistency checking. It also leads to more reliable interpretation of models across the product lifecycle due to more rigorous language semantics. An example language is described using these techniques.},

We discuss data, audio, and visuals as the content of a given system on the Internet. We also discuss the capabilities required from the next generation clients to this content. Furthermore, we discuss the four-tier architecture, the role of the presentation server within this four-tier architecture, and the responsibilities of a presentation server. Finally, we look at the benefits of the four-tier architecture, some specific implementation possibilities, and how it fits within the Internet as we know it today},

@article{Hayes1986,
abstract = {Everybody wants to boost factory performance. Before managers can take meaningful steps to do so, however, they need an accurate way to judge what good performance is and to compare performance among facilities. The trouble is, the measurement systems in place at many factories fail to tell managers what they really need to know. The authors studied 12 factories in 3 companies over time. They devised a new measuring system called total factor productivity (TFP) to gauge each plant's overall efficiency. They then identified the practices that, when managed right, really make a difference: investing in new equipment, reducing waste, and cutting work-in-progress inventories by solving the problems that produced them in the first place. Perhaps the study's most interesting finding is that what managers do to mitigate or fuel confusion within factories has a profound impact on TFP. Constantly changing the way things are done--materials used to make a product, manufacturing procedures, product specifications--disrupts operations, discourages people, and impedes learning. Good managers limit the number of changes introduced at any one time and carefully handle their implementation. Even spending big money on hardware fixes will not help if a factory's processes are out of control. There is no substitute for mastering firsthand the details of a factory's operation and constantly pushing to make it run better. Creating order and promoting understanding of factory processes make for a powerful combination--and a powerful lever on competitiveness.

abstract = {Application lifecycle management (ALM) highlights the rules of the road for the entire software ecosystems' lifecycle. Successful ALM enables clarity around the entire delivery effort, from defining requirements to deploying the software product. One of the challenges in software engineering today is to orchestrate ALM tools to a set of software projects effectively. In particular, it is challenging for software practitioners to continuously fully engage with the tasks that are assigned to them. The goal of this study is to address such situations using a game theoretic approach by utilizing a reward mechanism, which we intent to test in a medium-sized software development organization. Based on a set of game elements, this study proposes an auction mechanism to address human resource allocation and task optimization issues, and consequently tackle the potential problem of software practitioners' engagement. {\textcopyright} 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.},

abstract = {Copyright {\textcopyright} 2016 by ASME.Advances in information technology triggered a digital revolution that holds promise of reduced costs, improved productivity, and higher quality. To ride this wave of innovation, manufacturing enterprises are changing how product definitions are communicated - from paper to models. To achieve industry's vision of the Model-Based Enterprise (MBE), the MBE strategy must include model-based data interoperability from design to manufacturing and quality in the supply chain. The Model-Based Definition (MBD) is created by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) using Computer- Aided Design (CAD) tools. This information is then shared with the supplier so that they can manufacture and inspect the physical parts. Today, suppliers predominantly use Computer- Aided Manufacturing (CAM) and Coordinate Measuring Machine (CMM) models for these tasks. Traditionally, the OEM has provided design data to the supplier in the form of two-dimensional (2D) drawings, but may also include a threedimensional (3D)-shape-geometry model, often in a standardsbased format such as ISO 10303-203:2011 (STEP AP203). The supplier then creates the respective CAM and CMM models and machine programs to produce and inspect the parts. In the MBE vision for model-based data exchange, the CAD model must include product-and-manufacturing information (PMI) in addition to the shape geometry. Today's CAD tools can generate models with embedded PMI. And, with the emergence of STEP AP242, a standards-based model with embedded PMI can now be shared downstream. The on-going research detailed in this paper seeks to investigate three concepts. First, that the ability to utilize a STEP AP242 model with embedded PMI for CAD-to-CAM and CAD-to-CMM data exchange is possible and valuable to the overall goal of a more efficient process. Second, the research identifies gaps in tools, standards, and processes that inhibit industry's ability to cost-effectively achieve model-based-data interoperability in the pursuit of the MBE vision. Finally, it also seeks to explore the interaction between CAD and CMM processes and determine if the concept of feedback from CAM and CMM back to CAD is feasible. The main goal of our study is to test the hypothesis that model-based-data interoperability from CAD-to-CAM and CAD-to-CMM is feasible through standards-based integration. This paper presents several barriers to model-based-data interoperability. Overall, the project team demonstrated the exchange of product definition data between CAD, CAM, and CMM systems using standardsbased methods. While gaps in standards coverage were identified, the gaps should not stop industry's progress toward MBE. The results of our study provide evidence in support of an open-standards method to model-based-data interoperability, which would provide maximum value and impact to industry.},

abstract = {Product platforming is a technique for exploiting commonality across a family of products. While utilizing a common platform can have many advantages when developing and manufacturing products, the approach places greater demands on collaboration, in particular, the sharing and reuse of knowledge and information. Repositories are intended to facilitate information sharing across organizational groups and geographically distributed collaborators. A particular challenge in utilizing repositories is culling a search for the most appropriate information for the problem at hand. The Reuse Existing Unit for Shape and Efficiency (R.E.U.S.E.) method facilitates the search of information in a repository through three stages that consider similarity, efficiency, and configuration. Automated search and filter techniques are implemented with interaction with the user to effectively obtain the desired results. The similarity study uses thresholds to clarify different opportunities for reuse. The user can then select alternatives for further examination based on efficiency of satisfaction of desired characteristics. The degree of modification of the similar alternatives is reported to assist in the configuration of the new design. This method contributes to the field by (a) accounting for the variety of the product family during the reuse of existing process design information; (b) integrating an efficiency assessment for retrieval by considering characteristics beyond cost; and (c) addressing the search with a multicriteria method. The implementation of the R.E.U.S.E method is supported with an example of assembly line design for an air conditioner module in automobile production.},

The eRobotics methodology addresses this evolution by providing platforms where roboticist can exchange ideas and collaborate with experts from other disciplines for developing complex technical systems and automated solutions. Virtual Testbeds are the central method in eRobotics, where complex technical systems and their interaction with prospective working environments are first designed, programmed, controlled and optimized in simulation before commissioning the real system. On the other hand, Industry 4.0 concepts promote the notion of 'Digital Twins', virtual substitutes of real world objects consisting of virtual representations and communication capabilities making up smart objects acting as intelligent nodes inside the internet of things and services. Combining these two approaches, Virtual Testbeds and Digital Twins, leads to a new kind of 'Experimentable Digital Twins' breaking new ground in the simulation-based development and operation of complex technical systems. In this contribution, we describe how such 'Experimentable Digital Twins' can act as the very core of simulation-based development processes streamlining the development process, enabling detailed simulations at system level and realizing intelligent systems. Besides this, the multiple use of models and simulations in various scenarios significantly reduces the effort for the use of simulation technology throughout the life cycle of complex technical systems. 2016 IEEE.},

abstract = {Developing objective measures for evaluating and measuring the complexity of design would facilitate (1) empirical studies that require the use of equivalent but different design problems, (2) the development of design curriculums, and (3) the comparison of computer aided design automation tools. This paper surveys and evaluates different approaches to defining complexity in design for the design problem, process, and product. Three fundamental aspects to complexity are identified, size, coupling, and solvability, and expanded with respect to the three elements of design, problem, process, and product. Alternative methods for measuring these characteristics of the design are based on computational, information, and traditional design views of complexity. A method of measuring size as it relates to complexity is proposed for measuring the information content of design. A second method is proposed for decomposing a graph-based representation of design that provides a measure of the interconnectedness as it relates to complexity. Finally, two methods are proposed for determining the solvability complexity of design based on the effort involved and the degree of freedom of design. These measures are developed specifically for parametric and geometric problems as found in the embodiment design, but these principles may be applied beyond this. Copyright 2010 by ASME.},

@article{Cheung2009,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: As interest in adopting the Semantic Web in the biomedical domain continues to grow, Semantic Web technology has been evolving and maturing. A variety of technological approaches including triplestore technologies, SPARQL endpoints, Linked Data, and Vocabulary of Interlinked Datasets have emerged in recent years. In addition to the data warehouse construction, these technological approaches can be used to support dynamic query federation. As a community effort, the BioRDF task force, within the Semantic Web for Health Care and Life Sciences Interest Group, is exploring how these emerging approaches can be utilized to execute distributed queries across different neuroscience data sources. METHODS AND RESULTS: We have created two health care and life science knowledge bases. We have explored a variety of Semantic Web approaches to describe, map, and dynamically query multiple datasets. We have demonstrated several federation approaches that integrate diverse types of information about neurons and receptors that play an important role in basic, clinical, and translational neuroscience research. Particularly, we have created a prototype receptor explorer which uses OWL mappings to provide an integrated list of receptors and executes individual queries against different SPARQL endpoints. We have also employed the AIDA Toolkit, which is directed at groups of knowledge workers who cooperatively search, annotate, interpret, and enrich large collections of heterogeneous documents from diverse locations. We have explored a tool called "FeDeRate", which enables a global SPARQL query to be decomposed into subqueries against the remote databases offering either SPARQL or SQL query interfaces. Finally, we have explored how to use the vocabulary of interlinked Datasets (voiD) to create metadata for describing datasets exposed as Linked Data URIs or SPARQL endpoints. CONCLUSION: We have demonstrated the use of a set of novel and state-of-the-art Semantic Web technologies in support of a neuroscience query federation scenario. We have identified both the strengths and weaknesses of these technologies. While Semantic Web offers a global data model including the use of Uniform Resource Identifiers (URI's), the proliferation of semantically-equivalent URI's hinders large scale data integration. Our work helps direct research and tool development, which will be of benefit to this community.},

abstract = {Quality practitioners often identify robust parameter design (RPD) as one of the most important and effective methods for process and quality improvement. Within this framework, identifying the optimal factor settings that achieve desired process targets with minimum variance is critical and can translate to significant reductions in product waste and processing costs. In solving this problem, most traditional RPD models consider only a single quality characteristic of interest. However, products are often judged by multiple quality characteristics, which often have conflicting objectives. Conventional RPD models that address the multi-response problem typically only examine like-type cases, and those that consider mixed types of quality characteristics often overlook any asymmetry that is likely to exist in certain types. In contrast, this article proposes a multidisciplinary RPD methodology that provides an enhanced approach for modeling multiple, mixed type quality characteristics; uses the skew normal distribution to allow for a fuller and more accurate representation of asymmetric system properties and to facilitate simultaneous modeling of both symmetric and asymmetric conditions; and implements a priority-based optimization scheme that affords engineers' and decision makers' flexibility in establishing and modifying optimization priorities. A numerical example is used to demonstrate the proposed methodology, and the results are compared traditional approaches to illustrate potential improvements. Copyright 2013 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.},

abstract = {Experience in teaching engineering related subjects has shown that a complementary approach combining theoretical and practical exercises is vital for effective learning. Increasingly, teaching institutions are offering remote access to distant laboratories as part of an overall e-learning strategy. However, the majority of remote access laboratories developed to date have suffered from a major deficiency, namely the provision of a web-based environment that accurately recreates the group working and tutor driven experience of traditional on-campus based laboratories. This paper addresses this issue and presents a client–server architecture, based on Web services and .NET remoting services, for an integrated learning environment for remote experimentation that allows students in disparate locations to simultaneously and collaboratively complete complex experimental exercises.},

abstract = {A simple, nonstandardized material test specimen, which fails along one of two different likely crack paths, is considered herein. The result of deviations in geometry on the order of tenths of a millimeter, this ambiguity in crack path motivates the consideration of as manufactured component geometry in the design, assessment, and certification of structural systems. Herein, finite element models of as-manufactured specimens are generated and subsequently analyzed to resolve the crack-path ambiguity. The consequence and benefit of such a "personalized" methodology is the prediction of a crack path for each specimen based on its as-manufactured geometry, rather than a distribution of possible specimen geometries or nominal geometry. The consideration of as-manufactured characteristics is central to the Digital Twin concept. Therefore, this work is also intended to motivate its development.},

abstract = {Agile software development represents a major departure from traditional, plan-based approaches to software engineering. A systematic review of empirical studies of agile software development up to and including 2005 was conducted. The search strategy identified 1996 studies, of which 36 were identified as empirical studies. The studies were grouped into four themes: introduction and adoption, human and social factors, perceptions on agile methods, and comparative studies. The review investigates what is currently known about the benefits and limitations of, and the strength of evidence for, agile methods. Implications for research and practice are presented. The main implication for research is a need for more and better empirical studies of agile software development within a common research agenda. For the industrial readership, the review provides a map of findings, according to topic, that can be compared for relevance to their own settings and situations. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Nowzari2013,
abstract = {This paper considers a class of scenarios where targets emerge from some known location and move towards some unknown destinations in a weighted acyclic digraph. A decision maker with knowledge of the target positions must decide when preparations should be made at any given destination for their arrival. The decision maker faces a timing tradeoff: early decisions mean more time for preparation at the cost of higher uncertainty in the target's true destination while later decisions mean less uncertainty at the cost of having less time to prepare. We show how this problem can be formulated as an optimal stopping problem on aMarkov chain. This sets the basis for the introduction of the BEST INVESTMENT ALGORITHM which prescribes when investmentsmust be made conditioned on the target's motion along the digraph.We establish the optimality of this prescription and examine its robustness against changes in the problem parameters, identifying sufficient conditions to determine whether the solution computed by the BEST INVESTMENT ALGORITHM remains optimal. Based on this analysis, we develop the SELF-TRIGGERED ACQUISITION DECISION ALGORITHM that allows the decision maker, under partial knowledge of the parameter dynamics, to schedule in advance when to check if the control policy in its memory remains optimal and, if this test fails, when to recompute it. Finally, we obtain worst case lower bounds on the maximum time that can elapse under arbitrary parameter dynamics before the optimal solution must be recomputed. Simulations illustrate our results. 2012 IEEE.},

@phdthesis{Ricci2012,
abstract = {The aim of this thesis is to use the concept of uncertainty to improve the effectiveness of Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) systems. Uncertainty is a rather new concept in PLM that has been introduced with the new technical language, drawn by ISO, to manage Geometrical Product Specification and Verification (GPS) in the challenging environment of modern manufacturing. GPS standards regard in particular design and verification environments, and want to guarantee consistence of information through a technical language which define both specification and verification on sound logical and mathematical bases. In this context, uncertainty is introduced as the instrument that measures consistency: between the designer intentions (specifications) and the manufactured artefact (as it is observed through measurement) as well as between the measurand definition provided by designers (the specification again) and that used by metrologists. The implications of such an approach have been analyzed through a case study dealing with flatness tolerance and paying particular attention to the verification processes based on Coordinate Measuring Machines (CMM). A Design of Experiment (DoE) has been used and results have been analyzed and used to build a regression model that allows generalization in the experiment validity domain. Then, using Category Theory, a categorical data model has been defined which represents the operation based structure of GPS language and uses the flatness research results in order to design a software able to concretize the GPS vision of geometrical product specifications management. This software is able to translate specification requirements into verification instructions, estimate the uncertainty introduced by simplified verification operations and evaluate costs and risks of verification operations. It provides an important tool for designers, as it allows a responsible definition of specifications (designer can simulate the interpretation of specifications and have an idea of the costs related with their verification), and for metrologist, as it can be a guide for designing GPS compliant verification missions or handling the usual verification procedures according to the GPS standards. However, during the study, it has been matured the consciousness that this approach, even if correct and valuable, was not the most suitable to fully exploit the real potential of CMM. Then, aside the GPS oriented work, an adaptive sampling strategy, based on Kriging modelization, has been proposed with very encouraging results},

abstract = {This paper addresses the NASA Langley Multidisciplinary Uncertainty Quantification Challenge (MUQC) Problem, which is intended to pose challenges to the uncertainty quantification and robust design communities. The goals of the MUQC problem can be formulated into four main topics that are commonly encountered in the model development process: calibration, sensitivity analysis, uncertainty propagation, and robust design. Our analysis places a particular emphasis on the use of info-gap decision theory (IGDT) to address the goals of the MUQC problem. IGDT provides a convenient framework to treat epistemic uncertainty when using simulation models for decision-making. We utilize a robustness criterion, defined in the context of IGDT, to pursue calibration, uncertainty propagation, and robust design. Herein, our calibration utilizes IGDT to address the situation whereby traditional calibration techniques might result in non-unique results where different sets of calibration variables are able to replicate experiments with comparable fidelity. Uncertainty propagation is performed such that the worst-case and best-case performances of the model output are conditioned on the level of uncertainty that is permitted in the simulations. To pursue robust design, we utilize the robustness criterion to establish whether the amount of uncertainty tolerable in our optimized design is an improvement over the baseline design. We demonstrate that improving the robustness of the model requires different knowledge than improving performance of the model. The main conclusion is that IGDT provides a sound theoretical basis, and practical implementation, to meet the goals of the NASA MUQC problem without formulating simplifying assumptions.},

abstract = {This paper presents a comprehensive framework for the analysis of the impact of information sharing in hierarchical decision-making in manufacturing supply chains. In this framework, the process plan selection and real-time resource allocation problems are formulated as hierarchical optimization problems, where problems at each level in the hierarchy are solved by separate multi-objective genetic algorithms. The considered multi-objective genetic algorithms generate near optimal solutions for NP-hard problems with less computational complexity. In this work, a four-level hierarchical decision structure is considered, where the decision levels are defined as enterprise level, shop level, cell level, and equipment level. Using this framework, the sources of information affecting the achievement of best possible decisions are then identified at each of these levels, and the extent of their effects from sharing them are analyzed in terms of the axis, degree and the content of information. The generality and validity of the proposed approach have been successfully tested for diverse manufacturing systems generated from a designed experiment. 2010 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.},

abstract = {With the accelerated development of distributed generation (DG) technology, more and more scholars pay attention to micro-grid (MG). In the early decades, focus was put only on basic technologies. But in recent years, many new methods are being applied in this area, such as artificial intelligence, PSO (particle swarm optimization), interval-based MADM (multi-attribute decision making) using tradeoff analysis. Furthermore, the penetration of DG would influence the existing power market or other former rules of the power system. After reading plenty of publications, in this work we summarize the existed methods already put forward, and discuss some possible solutions that may well settle the following issues. a)power quality and stability; b) protection; c)power balance control policy; d) MG grid programming and economic operation.},

abstract = {Purpose – The evolution of six sigma has morphed from a method or set of techniques to a movement focused on business‐process improvement. Business processes are transformed through the successful selection and implementation of competing six sigma projects. However, the efforts to implement a six sigma process improvement initiative alone do not guarantee success. To meet aggressive schedules and tight budget constraints, a successful six sigma project needs to follow the proven define, measure, analyze, improve, and control methodology. Any slip in schedule or cost overrun is likely to offset the potential benefits achieved by implementing six sigma projects. The purpose of this paper is to focus on six sigma projects targeted at improving the overall customer satisfaction called Big Q projects. The aim is to develop a mathematical model to select one or more six sigma projects that result in the maximum benefit to the organization.Design/methodology/approach – This research provides the identification of important inputs and outputs for six sigma projects that are then analyzed using data envelopment analysis (DEA) to identify projects, which result in maximum benefit. Maximum benefit here provides a Pareto optimal solution based on inputs and outputs directly related to the efficiency of the six sigma projects under study. A sensitivity analysis of efficiency measurement is also carried out to study the impact of variation in projects' inputs and outputs on project performance and to identify the critical inputs and outputs.Findings – DEA, often used for relative efficiency analysis and productivity analysis, is now successfully constructed for six sigma project selection.Practical implications – Provides a practical approach to guide the selection of six sigma projects for implementation, especially for companies with limited resources. The sensitivity analysis discussed in the paper helps to understand the uncertainties in project inputs and outputs.Originality/value – This paper introduces DEA as a tool for six sigma project selection.},

abstract = {Computational and experimental fluid dynamics have been integrated into aeronautical system development processes in varying degrees over the last forty years and have yet to achieve their full promise for reducing the cost and time for development. What has been missing is a holistic advance in the integration not just of computers and wind tunnels but of the organizational constructs and development processes that enable unleashing the full capability of integrated computational and experimental methods. Recent Department of Defense (DoD) policies and guidance focused on organic engineering capabilities, government insight into technical performance, and application of system models over the life cycle are enabling a major paradigm shift toward life cycle integration of computational and experimental knowledge. In conjunction with these new policies, the United States Air Force is developing and applying a Digital Thread/Digital Twin analytical framework to provide engineering analysis capabilities and support to decision making over the entire lifecycle of air vehicles. The Digital Thread/Digital Twin merges physics-based modeling and experimental data to generate an authoritative digital representation of the system at each phase of the acquisition and sustainment process of a weapon system. In this paper the history of integrated computational and experimental fluid dynamics is reviewed as a precursor for the emerging paradigm shift toward a virtual government monopsony that enables a focused application of modeling capabilities and management of knowledge and tools over the life cycle. Illustrations of the potential impact of the new paradigm are also presented. 2016, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA. All Rights Reserved.},

This includes a detailed discussion on how to account for design uncertainties and how to measure robustness (i.e., how to evaluate robustness). The main focus will be on the different approaches to perform robust optimization in practice including the methods of mathematical programming, deterministic nonlinear optimization, and direct search methods such as stochastic approximation and evolutionary computation. It discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the different methods, thus, providing a basis for guiding the engineer to the most appropriate techniques.

@article{Kwak2015,
abstract = {Remanufacturing is emerging as a promising solution for achieving green, profitable businesses. This article considers a manufacturer that produces new products and also remanufactured versions of the new products that become available at the end of their life cycle. For such a manufacturer, design decisions at the initial design stage determine both the current profit from manufacturing and future profit from remanufacturing. To maximize the total profit, design decisions must carefully consider both ends of product life cycle, i.e. manufacturing and end-of-life stages. This article proposes a decision-support model for the life-cycle design using mixed-integer nonlinear programming. With an aim to maximize the total life-cycle profit, the proposed model searches for an (at least locally) optimal product design (i.e. design specifications and the selling price) for the new and remanufactured products. It optimizes both the initial design and design upgrades at the end-of-life stage and also provides corresponding production strategies, including production quantities and take-back rate. The model is extended to a multi-objective model that maximizes both economic profit and environmental-impact saving. To illustrate, the developed model is demonstrated with an example of a desktop computer.},

abstract = {Category theory has provided the foundations for many of the twentieth century's greatest advances in pure mathematics. This concise, original text for a one-semester course on the subject is derived from courses that author Emily Riehl taught at Harvard and Johns Hopkins Universities. The treatment introduces the essential concepts of category theory: categories, functors, natural transformations, the Yoneda lemma, limits and colimits, adjunctions, monads, and other topics. Suitable for advanced undergraduates and graduate students in mathematics, the text provides tools for understanding and attacking difficult problems in algebra, number theory, algebraic geometry, and algebraic topology. Drawing upon a broad range of mathematical examples from the categorical perspective, the author illustrates how the concepts and constructions of category theory arise from and illuminate more basic mathematical ideas. Prerequisites are limited to familiarity with some basic set theory and logic.},

abstract = {This paper reviews literature that identifies the need for decision-making associated with the design and operation of electric power grids including microgrids. In particular, it examines the current applications of analytic hierarchy process (AHP) as the decision-making tool for electric power grids and microgrids. AHP is a decision making tool based on expert judgments that has been successfully applied in design and operation for the power systems. One advantage of AHP is its ability to incorporate subjective constraints. The current application of AHP to grid connected power systems includes selection of generating units, identifying protection system vulnerability, prioritizing line maintenance, determining DG deployment and configurations, analyzing energy planning under uncertainty, locating and sizing of VAR sources, value based budgeting, choosing dispatch scenarios, forecasting loads, integrated resource planning, and determining combined active and reactive dispatch AHP has been applied to islanded microgrids for load shedding and optimizing cost. This paper concludes with proposals for expanding the use of AHP for decision-making for islanded microgrids.},

@article{Boothroyd1994,
abstract = {Design is the first step in manufacturing, and it is where most of the important decisions are made that affect the final cost of a product. Since 1980, analysis techniques have been made available which can guide designers towards products which are easy to manufacture and assemble. The availability of these techniques has created a revolution in manufacturing industry, especially in the USA, leading to reduced product cost, better quality, shorter time to market, lower inventory, few suppliers, and many other improvements. The paper first stresses the importance of taking careful account of manufacturing and assembly problems in the early stages of product design. Then, using a case study, the philosophy of the Design for Manufacture and Assembly (DFMA) methodology and its application are explained. The historical development of dessgn-for-assembly and design-for- techniques in Japan, Europe and the USA is presented. A review of published case histories emphasizes the enormous advantages to be gained by adopting this relatively new approach as the major tool in concurrent and simultaneous engineering. Finally, a discussion of the various roadblocks affecting DFMA implementation is followed by a discussion of current developments, which include product design for disassembly, service and recycling.},

Because many engineers and companies participate in the complex design of automobiles, the design process depends on the team members' ability to share information on essential design elements. These trends have elevated the importance of the quality of digital product data and its efficient exchange. We review the state of the arts for product data quality (PDQ), as well as 3-D model quality assurance systems for the PDQ improvements. We propose a method for diagnosing and repairing CAD model errors based on the design history.},

These annotations can provide valuable information to support an improved design intent communication. Comparably, they can play the same role as source code comments to support code maintainability in software engineering. A 3D CAD model is a geometry representation and it also stores the modeling strategy used to build it. Alteration of a complex CAD model usually represents a time consuming task due to the lack of an explicit explanation of the design rationale followed to build that 3D model. An experimental study conducted with Spanish and Mexican CAD students indicates that it is possible to reduce the time needed to perform engineering changes in existing models by between 13–26{\%} by using annotations. Also some factors that affect the impact of annotations on the engineering change process such as part and alteration complexity were identified.},

abstract = {The problem of aircraft sizing during conceptual design is characterized by limited knowledge and high uncertainty. Design decisions during this phase must be made to allow for minimal cost changes as many of these uncertainties are resolved later in the design process. Correspondingly, robust design considerations should be incorporated into the conceptual design trade space exploration and optimization problem to indicate design choices that are both "balanced" in performance and resistant to possible losses due to uncertainties. This paper presents a study of the effects of uncertainty on multi-objective optimization in aircraft conceptual design by visualizing the effects of uncertainty on the shape of Pareto frontiers in the performance objectives and the corresponding design variables. By qualitatively analyzing the shape of these frontiers, the decision maker can see the tradeoff between expected performance and robustness and identify regions of the design space where this tradeoff is favorable or high-risk. The paper begins by posing the programmatic relevance of the problem and then reviewing existing techniques for risk assessment and robustness in conceptual design. Next, mathematical background pertaining to Pareto frontiers of various dimensions and a review of robust design techniques is provided. Finally the techniques are applied to a case study of the conceptual sizing of a lightweight jet aircraft to show how they can be used to better understand the effects of uncertainty in the conceptual design phase, enabling improved design decision making.

abstract = {This paper demonstrates that the traditional categorization of innovation as either incremental or radical is incomplete and potentially misleading and does not account for the sometimes disastrous effects on industry incumbents of seemingly minor improvements in technological products. We examine such innovations more closely and, distinguishing between the components of a product and the ways they are integrated into the system that is the product "architecture," define them as innovations that change the architecture of a product without changing its components. We show that architectural innovations destroy the usefulness of the architectural knowledge of established firms, and that since architectural knowledge tends to become embedded in the structure and information-processing procedures of established organizations, this destruction is difficult for firms to recognize and hard to correct. Architectural innovation therefore presents established organizations with subtle challenges that may have significant competitive implications. We illustrate the concept's explanatory force through an empirical study of the semiconductor photolithographic alignment equipment industry, which has experienced a number of architectural innovations.},

Typical errors and mistakes in human planning and decision making are reported and related to characteristics of the human information processing system. It is demonstrated that a lot of very different errors and mistakes are based on a few characteristies of the human mind. Additionally we demonstrate that it is in no way simple to avoid these mistakes, as these information processing characteristies of the human mind are otherwise quite functional in a number of contexts.},

abstract = {The semiconductor and thin-film transistor liquid crystal display (TFT-LCD) industries are currently two of the most important high-tech industries in Taiwan and occupy over 40{\%} of the global market share. Moreover, these two industries need huge investments in manufacture production equipments (PE) and own a large production scale of the global market. Therefore, how to increase the processing quality of PE to raise the production capacity has become an important issue. The statistical process control technique is usually adopted to monitor the important process parameters in the current Fabs. Furthermore, a routine check for machine or a predictive maintenance policy is generally applied to enhance the stability of process and improve yields. However, manufacturing system cannot be obtained online quality measurements during the manufacturing process. When the abnormal conditions occur, it will cause a large number of scrapped substrates and the costs will be seriously raised. In this research, a virtual metrology (VM) system is proposed to overcome those mentioned problems. It not only fulfills real-time quality measurement of each wafer, but also detects the performance degradation of the corresponding machines from the information of manufacturing processes. This paper makes four critical contributions: (1) The more principal component analysis (PCA) we used, the higher the accuracy we obtained by the kernel function approach; (2) the more support vector data description (SVDD) we used, the higher the accuracy we obtain in novelty detection module; (3) our empirical results show that genetic algorithm (GA) and incremental learning methods increase the training/learning of support vector machine (SVM) model; and (4) by developing a wafer quality prediction model, the SVM approach obtains better prediction accuracy than the radial basis function neural network (RBFN) and back-propagation neural network (BPNN) approaches. Therefore, this paper proposes that the artificial intelligent (AI) approach could be a more suitable methodology than traditional statistics for predicting the potential scrapped substrates risk of semiconductor manufacturing companies. 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Our next generation of industry—Industry 4.0—holds the promise of increased flexibility in manufacturing, along with mass customization, better quality, and improved productivity. It thus enables companies to cope with the challenges of producing increasingly individualized products with a short lead-time to market and higher quality. Intelligent manufacturing plays an important role in Industry 4.0. Typical resources are converted into intelligent objects so that they are able to sense, act, and behave within a smart environment. In order to fully understand intelligent manufacturing in the context of Industry 4.0, this paper provides a comprehensive review of associated topics such as intelligent manufacturing, Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled manufacturing, and cloud manufacturing. Similarities and differences in these topics are highlighted based on our analysis. We also review key technologies such as the IoT, cyber-physical systems (CPSs), cloud computing, big data analytics (BDA), and information and communications technology (ICT) that are used to enable intelligent manufacturing. Next, we describe worldwide movements in intelligent manufacturing, including governmental strategic plans from different countries and strategic plans from major international companies in the European Union, United States, Japan, and China. Finally, we present current challenges and future research directions. The concepts discussed in this paper will spark new ideas in the effort to realize the much-anticipated Fourth Industrial Revolution.},

Further, it is explained that leveraging on human and organizational factors, instead of appealing mainly to the technological ones, opens opportunities to improving decisions and save resources.

abstract = {This paper presents a Decision Support System (DSS) for market-driven product positioning and design, based on market data and design parameters. The proposed DSS determines market segments for new products using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), K-means, and AdaBoost classification. The system combines the data integrity, security, and reliability of a database with the unparalleled analytical capability of the Matlab tool suite through an intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI). This GUI allows users to explore and evaluate alternative scenarios during product development. To demonstrate the usefulness of the proposed system, we conducted a case study using US automotive market data. For this case study, the proposed DSS achieved classification accuracies in a range from 76.1{\%} to 93.5{\%} for different scenarios. These high accuracy levels make us confident that the DSS can benefit enterprise decision makers by providing an objective second opinion on the question: To which market segment does a new product design belong? Having information about the market segment implies that the competition is known and marketing can position the product accurately. Furthermore, the design parameters can be adjusted such that (a) the new product fits this market segment better or (b) the new product is relocated to a different market segment. Therefore, the proposed system enables enterprises to make better informed decisions for market-driven product positioning and design.},

The notion of trustworthiness, though, is subject to individual interpretation and preference, e.g., organizations require confidence about how their business critical data is handled whereas end-users may be more concerned about usability. As one main contribution, we present an extensive list of software quality attributes that contribute to trustworthiness. Those software quality attributes have been identified by a systematic review of the research literature and by analyzing two real-world use cases. As a second contribution, we sketch an approach for systematically deriving metrics to measure the trustworthiness of software system. Our work thereby contributes to better understanding which software quality attributes should be considered and assured when engineering trustworthy Internet-based software systems.},

abstract = {Recent cuts to NASA's planetary exploration budget have precipitated a debate in the community on whether large flagship missions to planetary bodies in the outer solar system or sequences of smaller missions as part of a long-term exploration program would be more beneficial. The work presented explores the trade between these two approaches as applied to the exploration of Europa and concentrates on identifying combinations of flyby, orbiter and/or lander missions that achieve high value at a lower cost than the Jupiter Europa Orbiter (JEO) flagship mission concept. The effects of the value attributed to the four main science objectives for Europa, which can be broadly classified as investigating the ocean, ice-shell, composition and geology, are demonstrated. The current approach proposed to complete the ocean exploration objective is shown to have conflicting requirements with the other three objectives. For missions that fully address all the science objectives, such as JEO, the ocean goal is therefore found to be the main cost driver. Instrument combinations for low-cost flyby missions are also presented, and simple lander designs able to achieve a wide range of objectives at a low additional cost are identified. Finally, the current designs for the Europa Habitability Mission (EHM) are compared to others in the trade space, based on the prioritization given to the science goals for the exploration of Europa. The current EHM flyby mission (Clipper) is found to be highly promising in terms of providing very high potential science value at a low cost.},

abstract = {In this article, we describe simulation-based decision support techniques for evaluation of operational plans within effects-based planning. Using a decision support tool, developers of operational plans are able to evaluate thousands of alternative plans against possible courses of events and decide which of these plans are capable of achieving a desired end state. The objective of this study is to examine the potential of a decision support system that helps operational analysts understand the consequences of numerous alternative plans through simulation and evaluation. Operational plans are described in the effects-based approach to operations concept as a set of actions and effects. For each action, we examine several different alternative ways to perform the action. We use a representation where a plan consists of several actions that should be performed. Each action may be performed in one of several different alternative ways. Together these action alternatives make up all possible plan instances, which are represented as a tree of action alternatives that may be searched for the most effective sequence of alternative actions. As a test case, we use an expeditionary operation with a plan of 43 actions and several alternatives for these actions, as well as a scenario of 40 group actors. Decision support for planners is provided by several methods that analyze the impact of a plan on the 40 actors, e.g., by visualizing time series of plan performance. Detailed decision support for finding the most influential actions of a plan is presented by using sensitivity analysis and regression tree analysis. Finally, a decision maker may use the tool to determine the boundaries of an operation that it must not move beyond without risk of drastic failure. The significant contribution of this study is the presentation of an integrated approach for evaluation of operational plans.},

abstract = {Developments in the capabilities of the manufacturing processes increased the number of processes that can produce a part within the requirements determined by its design and market research. The increased number of processes and unfamiliarity of manufacturing engineers to many new manufacturing processes forces the researchers to develop systematic process selection tools instead of depending on the accumulated human expertise only. In this paper, a net-shape primary manufacturing process selection decision support system (DSS), which is named PROSEL (PROcess SELection), is developed. The developed selection programme eliminates the unsuitable processes step by step by checking a part?s material, annual production quantity, specified shape, thickness and presents the most economical process as the most appropriate net-shape primary process after a final cost analysis. The developed DSS is written in Visual Studio and tested with a great deal of real-life examples. It can be concluded from the tests that the programme provides the same or better primary manufacturing process selection decisions than the practical usage, and it is a very useful support tool for net-shape primary process selections.},

abstract = {Managing the related but distinct processes of "product design and engineering" and manufacturing in an integrated way poses significant challenges for many industrial enterprises. This study presents a systematic review of the literature focused on the interface between these two areas. The review has identified six core themes based on 49 retrieved papers: (A) Integral Productivity, (B) Order Entry Points and Modularity, (C) Product Life Cycle Management, (D) Sourcing Decisions and Supplier Involvement, (E) Integrated Processes and Coordination, and (F) Enabling through Information and Communication Technology. Five of these themes, A-E, are discussed in the paper, using the retrieved works complemented by additional literature, case evidence from the literature as well as additional cases. A generic reference model is used to support the in-depth review of literature and cases. The study shows that tremendous progress during the past 20 years has been made in approaches for managing the interface by both researchers providing generic concepts and practitioners to overcome obstacles for implementation; at the same the paper also identifies gaps in the literature from both theoretical and practical perspectives. An extensive research agenda is proposed to address the gaps identified. It is argued that across all themes further research on this critical interface needs to consider the degree of novelty in new product development, engineering and manufacturing as mediating factor. However, it is also noted that companies seem to manage this interface effectively despite it being challenging, albeit sometimes very practically and intuitively.},

abstract = {The goal of this paper is to propose an approach to enhance interoperability between manufacturing applications using the Core Manufacturing Simulation Data Information Model (CMSDIM) in order to streamline design and manufacturing activities throughout the product life cycle. To this end, a system framework required to facilitate such interoperability is first presented. The proposed approach, architecture, and developed translators are then illustrated and demonstrated using two separate case studies. The first case study facilitates design for manufacturing and assembly improvements for the development of new products, allowing for part of a discrete event simulation model of a downstream manufacturing and assembly process to be automatically generated from corresponding product assembly information contained in the lean design engineering software. Conceptual design and development of this case study, which extracts outputs from Design Profit™ lean design software and generates a corresponding discrete event simulation model in ProModel™ for a Nikon{\textregistered} L-100 Camera, is then discussed. The second case study demonstrates interoperability of three applications (order and inventory system, Gantt chart scheduler, and discrete event simulation) for a generic job shop operation. Using the considered case studies, this paper also details and demonstrates the benefits of interoperability enhancement using the CMSDIM, which is an important consideration in any product life cycle. Finally, we discuss how future research opportunities integrating additional manufacturing applications can be used to address intellectual challenges present in our current approach.},

abstract = {Assessing the quality of a weld in the steelmaking industry is a complex task. The level of complexity increases when the assessment is based on non-destructive tests. Skilled technicians are often required to make a decision based on automatic assessments of welds. Technicians consider the results of the automatic assessments and use their expert knowledge in order to make a final decision about the quality of the weld. In this paper we propose a decision support system to assess the quality of resistance seam welds of steel strips based on statistical analysis of both the mechanical and electrical variables involved in the welding process to be assessed as well as previously recorded historical data of similar welds. The proposed system is designed following component model based software architecture. The system consists of a set of orthogonal modules: welding variable measurement, welding variable processing and welding quality assessment, communicated by means of dedicated interfaces. The proposed system has been installed in three steel manufacturing lines. With the reduction in the time spent by technicians to make a decision about each weld, the productivity of the manufacturing line has greatly improved. Furthermore, production costs have been reduced since the number of defective welds assessed as non-defective was reduced, and thus the failures in the manufacturing lines due to weld breakages. The experimental results after two years of use in a steel strip galvanizing line are shown.},

abstract = {As defined by major dimensional metrology system users and suppliers, the Quality Information Framework (QIF) is an integrated and holistic set of information models which, if widely adopted, can enable the effective exchange of metrology data throughout the entire manufacturing quality measurement process - from design to planning to execution to analysis. This paper introduces the philosophy and rationale behind QIF, as well as some of its detailed content. QIF is a set of XML data models, which if broadly and correctly implemented in vendor software, will allow quality software and hardware to exchange data freely and effectively. Past standard efforts in manufacturing quality systems have had a variety of shortcomings, which QIF plans to overcome. The data models developed during the first year of QIF project include the QIF XML schema library and the Quality Measurement Results (QMResults) schema. A new modeling method, used to model quality characteristics and measurement features, is able to cover different use cases such as reverse engineering, batch quality measurement, and discrete quality measurement. Correct semantic associations between measurement feature and quality characteristics, and between nominal values and actual values are guaranteed by implementing strong typing using identifiers. The next step of QIF project is to conduct a set of pilot tests to serve as validation and demonstration of the information models.},

abstract = {The Product Lifecycle Management (PLM) concept holds the promise of seamlessly integrating all the information produced throughout all phases of a product's life cycle to everyone in an organization at every managerial and technical level, along with key suppliers and customers. PLM systems are tools that implement the PLM concept. As such, they need the capability to serve up the information referred to above, and they need to ensure the cohesion and traceability of product data. We describe a product information-modeling framework that we believe can support the full range of PLM information needs. The framework is based on the NIST Core Product Model (CPM) and its extensions, the Open Assembly Model (OAM), the Design-Analysis Integration model (DAIM) and the Product Family Evolution Model (PFEM). These are abstract models with general semantics, with the specific semantics about a particular domain to be embedded within the usage of the models for that domain. CPM represents the product's function, form and behavior, its physical and functional decompositions, and the relationships among these concepts. An extension of CPM provides a way to associate design rationale with the product. OAM defines a system level conceptual model and the associated hierarchical assembly relationships. DAIM defines a Master Model of the product and a series of abstractions called Functional Models—one for each domain-specific aspect of the product—and two transformations, called idealization and mapping, between the master model and each functional model. PFEM extends the representation to families of products and their components; it also extends design rationale to the capture of the rationale for the evolution of the families. The framework is intended to: (1) capture product, design rationale, assembly, and tolerance information from the earliest conceptual design stage—where designers deal with the function and performance of products—to the full lifecycle; (2) facilitate the semantic interoperability of next-generation CAD/CAE/CAM systems; and (3) capture the evolution of products and product families. The relevance of our framework to PLM systems is that any data component in the framework can be accessed directly by a PLM system, providing fine-grained access to the product's description and design rationale.},

Increasingly high penetration level of photovoltaic (PV) generation arises in smart grid. Solar power is intermittent and variable, as the solar source at the ground level is highly dependent on cloud cover variability, atmospheric aerosol levels, and other atmosphere parameters. The inherent variability of large-scale solar generation introduces significant challenges to smart grid energy management. Accurate forecasting of solar power/irradiance is critical to secure economic operation of the smart grid. This paper provides a comprehensive review of the theoretical forecasting methodologies for both solar resource and PV power.

abstract = {We consider recovery of low-rank matrices from noisy data by hard thresholding of singular values, in which empirical singular values below a threshold {\&}{\#}x03BB; are set to 0. We study the asymptotic mean squared error (AMSE) in a framework, where the matrix size is large compared with the rank of the matrix to be recovered, and the signal-to-noise ratio of the low-rank piece stays constant. The AMSE-optimal choice of hard threshold, in the case of n-by-n matrix in white noise of level {\&}{\#}x03C3;, is simply (4/{\&}{\#}x221A;3){\&}{\#}x221A;n{\&}{\#}x03C3; {\&}{\#}x2248; 2.309{\&}{\#}x221A;n{\&}{\#}x03C3; when {\&}{\#}x03C3; is known, or simply 2.858 {\&}{\#}x00B7; y{\textless}sub{\textgreater}med{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} when {\&}{\#}x03C3; is unknown, where y{\textless}sub{\textgreater}med{\textless}/sub{\textgreater} is the median empirical singular value. For nonsquare, m by n matrices with m {\&}{\#}x2260; n the thresholding coefficients 4/{\&}{\#}x221A;3 and 2.858 are replaced with different provided constants that depend on m/n. Asymptotically, this thresholding rule adapts to unknown rank and unknown noise level in an optimal manner: it is always better than hard thresholding at any other value, and is always better than ideal truncated singular value decomposition (TSVD), which truncates at the true rank of the low-rank matrix we are trying to recover. Hard thresholding at the recommended value to recover an n-by-n matrix of rank r guarantees an AMSE at most 3 nr{\&}{\#}x03C3;{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}. In comparison, the guarantees provided by TSVD, optimally tuned singular value soft thresholding and the best guarantee achievable by any shrinkage of the data singular values are 5 nr{\&}{\#}x03C3;{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, 6 nr{\&}{\#}x03C3;{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, and 2 nr{\&}{\#}x03C3;{\textless}sup{\textgreater}2{\textless}/sup{\textgreater}, respectively. The recommended value for hard threshold also offers, among hard thresholds, the best possible AMSE guarantees for recovering matrices with bounded nuclear norm. Empirical evidence suggests that performance improvement over TSVD and other popular shrinkage rules can be substantial, for different noise distributions, even in relatively small n.},

A traceability interface (traceability nc{\_}functions) is defined for the new CNC programming standard ISO STEP-NC. CAM systems will be able to program monitoring and data access activities by inserting traceability nc{\_}function calls in CNC programs. On the shop floor, controllers will automatically interpret these nc{\_}functions to access process data while machining and will relate data records with the corresponding machining operations in a STEP-NC part program. With both types of information—process data and standard machining program (STEP-NC part program)—spread and technologically heterogeneous engineering systems will have full knowledge about what has happened in production. Traceability data access automation will assure data reliability.

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to raise awareness among manufacturing researchers and practitioners of the potential of Bayesian networks (BNs) to enhance decision making in those parts of the manufacturing domain where uncertainty is a key characteristic. In doing so, the paper describes the development of an intelligent decision support system (DSS) to help operators in Motorola to diagnose and correct faults during the process of product system testing. Design/methodology/approach - The intelligent (DSS) combines BNs and an intelligent user interface to produce multi-media advice for operators. Findings - Surveys show that the system is effective in considerably reducing fault correction times for most operators and most fault types and in helping inexperienced operators to approach the performance levels of experienced operators. Originality/value - Such efficiency improvements are of obvious value in manufacturing. In this particular case, additional benefit was derived when the product testing facility was moved from the UK to China as the system was able to help the new operators to get close to the historical performance level of experienced operators. 2011 Emerald Group Publishing Limited.

@article{HedbergJr2016,
abstract = {Exchange and reuse of three-dimensional (3D) product models are hampered by the absence of trust in product-lifecycle data quality. The root cause of the missing trust is years of "silo" functions (e.g., engineering, manufacturing, and quality assurance) using independent and disconnected processes. Those disconnected processes result in data exchanges that do not contain all of the required information for each downstream lifecycle process, which inhibits the reuse of product data and results in duplicate data. The X.509 standard, maintained by the Telecommunication Standardization Sector of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU-T), was first issued in 1988. Although originally intended as the authentication framework for the X.500 series for electronic directory services, the X.509 framework is used in a wide range of implementations outside the originally intended paradigm. These implementations range from encrypting websites to software-code signing, yet X.509 certificate use has not widely penetrated engineering and product realms. Our approach is not trying to provide security mechanisms, but equally as important, our method aims to provide insight into what is happening with product data to support trusting the data. This paper provides a review of the use of X.509 certificates and proposes a solution for embedding X.509 digital certificates in 3D models for authentication, authorization, and traceability of product data. This paper also describes an application within the aerospace domain. Finally, the paper draws conclusions and provides recommendations for further research into using X.509 certificates in product lifecycle management (PLM) workflows to enable a product lifecycle of trust.},

@article{Ghosh2013,
abstract = {Modeling uncertainty through probabilistic representation in engineering design is common and important to decision making that considers risk. However, representations of uncertainty often ignore elements of "imprecision" that may limit the robustness of decisions. Furthermore, current approaches that incorporate imprecision suffer from computational expense and relatively high solution error. This work presents a method that allows imprecision to be incorporated into design scenarios while providing computational efficiency and low solution error for uncertainty propagation. The work draws on an existing method for representing imprecision and integrates methods for sparse grid numerical integration, resulting in the computationally efficient imprecise uncertainty propagation (CEIUP) method. This paper presents details of the method and demonstrates the effectiveness on both numerical case studies, and a thermocouple performance problem found in the literature. Results for the numerical case studies, in most cases, demonstrate improvements in both computational efficiency and solution accuracy for varying problem dimension and variable interaction when compared to optimized parameter sampling (OPS). For the thermocouple problem, similar behavior is observed when compared to OPS. The paper concludes with an overview of design problem scenarios in which CEIUP is the preferred method and offers opportunities for extending the method. 2013 by ASME.},

@article{Resende2012,
abstract = {In new product design, risk averse firms must consider downside risk in addition to expected profitability, since some designs are associated with greater market uncertainty than others. We propose an approach to robust optimal product design for profit maximization by introducing an -profit metric to manage expected profitability vs. downside risk due to uncertainty in market share predictions. Our goal is to maximize profit at a firm-specified level of risk tolerance. Specifically, we find the design that maximizes the -profit: the value that the firm has a (1 - ) chance of exceeding, given the distribution of possible outcomes. The parameter (0,1) is set by the firm to reflect sensitivity to downside risk (or upside gain), and parametric study of reveals the sensitivity of optimal design choices to firm risk preference. We account here only for uncertainty of choice model parameter estimates due to finite data sampling when the choice model is assumed to be correctly specified (no misspecification error). We apply the delta method to estimate the mapping from uncertainty in discrete choice model parameters to uncertainty of profit outcomes and identify the estimated -profit as a closed-form function of decision variables for the multinomial logit model. An example demonstrates implementation of the method to find the optimal design characteristics of a dial-readout scale using conjoint data. 2012 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.},

@article{Camba2014,
abstract = {A successful implementation of the Model-Based Enterprise concept (MBE) requires maximizing the potential benefits of annotated 3D models. The foundations of the MBE model are established by digital product definition data practices, which are currently regulated by standards such as ASME Y14.41-2003 and ISO 16792:2006. At the center of the MBE concept is the notion of CAD model reusability, which relies on the idea that 3D CAD models can be reused both throughout the entire product lifecycle and as a starting point for future development of new products. In this context, a critical aspect of CAD model reuse is the proper identification and understanding of the geometric design intent that is usually expressed implicitly within the CAD model. In this work, we present a method to communicate geometric design intent explicitly by overloading and extending the scope of the current annotation instruments available in the MBE approach. We propose a new broader type of model annotation that we call “extended annotation”, where design information is represented both internally within the 3D model and externally, on a separate repository. This structure naturally demands additional mechanisms to support the interaction of users with the information. In order to manage the information stored in these extended annotations effectively, we implemented an annotation manager that automatically synchronizes the dual representation of the annotations. To reduce the visual clutter in the 3D model, the software provides powerful filtering, editing, and visualization capabilities, giving users complete control of the information stored in the model. Finally, a study was conducted with 60 participants to evaluate the performance of the proposed model and the usability of the annotation manager. Results show a statistically significant benefit of using the extended annotation system, suggesting the use of this model as a valuable approach to improve design intent communication.},

abstract = {Mobile app stores provide a unique platform for developers to rapidly deploy new updates of their apps. We studied the frequency of updates of 10,713 mobile apps (the top free 400 apps at the start of 2014 in each of the 30 categories in the Google Play store). We find that a small subset of these apps (98 apps representing ˜1 {\%} of the studied apps) are updated at a very frequent rate — more than one update per week and 14 {\%} of the studied apps are updated on a bi-weekly basis (or more frequently). We observed that 45 {\%} of the frequently-updated apps do not provide the users with any information about the rationale for the new updates and updates exhibit a median growth in size of 6 {\%}. This paper provides information regarding the update strategies employed by the top mobile apps. The results of our study show that 1) developers should not shy away from updating their apps very frequently, however the frequency varies across store categories. 2) Developers do not need to be too concerned about detailing the content of new updates. It appears that users are not too concerned about such information. 3) Users highly rank frequently-updated apps instead of being annoyed about the high update frequency.},

abstract = {Design for manufacturing (DFM), especially the use of manufacturing knowledge to support design decisions, has received attention in the academic domain. However, industry practice has not been studied enough to provide solutions that are mature for industry. The current state of the art for DFM is often rule-based functionality within computer-aided design (CAD) systems that enforce specific design requirements. That rule-based functionality may or may not dynamically affect geometry definition. And, if rule-based functionality exists in the CAD system, it is typically a customisation on a case-by-case basis. Manufacturing knowledge is a phrase with vast meanings, which may include knowledge on the effects of material properties decisions, machine and process capabilities or understanding the unintended consequences of design decisions on manufacturing. One of the DFM questions to answer is: How can manufacturing knowledge, depending on its definition, be used earlier in the product life cycle to enable a more collaborative development environment? This paper will discuss the results of a workshop on manufacturing knowledge that highlights several research questions needing more study. This paper proposes recommendations for investigating the relationship of manufacturing knowledge with shape, behaviour and context characteristics of a product to produce a better understanding of what knowledge is most important. In addition, the proposal includes recommendations for investigating the system-level barriers to reusing manufacturing knowledge and how model-based manufacturing may ease the burden of knowledge sharing. Lastly, the proposal addresses the direction of future research for holistic solutions of using manufacturing knowledge earlier in the product life cycle.},

@article{Ciucci2012,
abstract = {As engineering systems grow in complexity, it becomes more challenging to achieve system-level designs that effectively balance the trade-offs among subsystems. Lewis and others have developed a well-known, traditional game-theoretic approach for formally modeling complex systems that can locate a Nash equilibrium design with a minimum of information sharing in the form of a point design. This paper builds on Lewis' work by proposing algorithms that are capable of converging to Pareto-optimal system-level designs by increasing cooperation among subsystems through additional passed information. This paper investigates several forms for this additional passed information, including both quadratic and eigen-based formulations. Such forms offer guidance to designers on how they should change parameter values to better suit the overall system by providing information on directionality and curvature. Strategies for representing passed information are examined in three case studies of 2- and 3-player scenarios that cover a range of system complexity. Depending on the scenario, findings suggest that passing more information generally leads to convergence to a Pareto-optimal set. However, more iterations may be required to reach the Pareto set than if using a traditional game-theoretic approach.},

@book{Spivak2014,
abstract = {Category theory was invented in the 1940s to unify and synthesize different areas in mathematics, and it has proven remarkably successful in enabling powerful communication between disparate fields and subfields within mathematics. This book shows that category theory can be useful outside of mathematics as a rigorous, flexible, and coherent modeling language throughout the sciences. Information is inherently dynamic; the same ideas can be organized and reorganized in countless ways, and the ability to translate between such organizational structures is becoming increasingly important in the sciences. Category theory offers a unifying framework for information modeling that can facilitate the translation of knowledge between disciplines. Written in an engaging and straightforward style, and assuming little background in mathematics, the book is rigorous but accessible to non-mathematicians. Using databases as an entry to category theory, it begins with sets and functions, then introduces the reader to notions that are fundamental in mathematics: monoids, groups, orders, and graphs—categories in disguise. After explaining the “big three” concepts of category theory—categories, functors, and natural transformations—the book covers other topics, including limits, colimits, functor categories, sheaves, monads, and operads. The book explains category theory by examples and exercises rather than focusing on theorems and proofs. It includes more than 300 exercises, with solutions. Category Theory for the Sciences is intended to create a bridge between the vast array of mathematical concepts used by mathematicians and the models and frameworks of such scientific disciplines as computation, neuroscience, and physics.},

abstract = {An experimental procedure for qualifying material properties from cyclically worked parts was investigated in support of aging gas turbine engines and digital twin initiatives. For aging components, remanufacturing or repair efforts are necessary to sustain the life cycles of engines; and for digital twin, the virtual representation of a part requires accurate geometric and component material property measurement. Therefore, having an effective, non-destructive way to assess the material performance of parts is necessary. Since low cycle, low strain, mechanical testing is the ideal experimental approach for nondestructively assessing material properties, investigating the accuracy and trends of tensile properties of fatigue loaded parts was important. The fatigued parts used for this study were specimens tested according to the George Fatigue Method, and the materials observed were cold-rolled Inconel Alloys 625 and 718, and direct metal laser sintering (DMLS) Nickel Alloy 718. The tensile material properties were compared against pristine (non-fatigued) and published data. The comparison for the cold-rolled 625 and 718 results show an increase and a decrease, depending on rolling direction, of tensile strength due to the effects of fatigue cycles; however, the variation of the vibration affected tensile properties are all within one standard deviation of the pristine data. The comparisons of DMLS Nickel Alloys was conducted against two sets of alloys from different suppliers, and the results showed that the tensile properties are sensitive to DMLS manufacturing parameters and post-sintering processes. A digital twin related, nondestructive, material property determination technique is also discussed in this manuscript. The true alloy density was determined with the water displacement method, and elastic modulus is determined with an iterative Ritz method model. The modulus is under-predicted with this method, but suggestions for improving the model are discussed. Copyright 2014 by ASME.},

abstract = {This article investigates the influence of the quality of teamwork on the performance effects of domain-relevant skills and creative-thinking skills in innovation teams. We propose that the quality of teamwork is an important moderating condition facilitating the application of domain-relevant skills, while obstructing the application of creative-thinking skills. Using data from 575 members, leaders, and managers of 145 software development teams, we test direct and moderated relationships between teams' domain-relevant skills and creative-thinking skills with team effectiveness and efficiency. Results show that neither domain-relevant skills nor creative-thinking skills have direct effects on team effectiveness (i.e., quality of the software product) and team efficiency (i.e., adherence to schedule and budget objectives). However, the results show that teamwork quality has positive effects on the relationship between domain-relevant skills and team efficiency, while having negative effects on the relationship between creative-thinking skills and both team efficiency and effectiveness. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

In this paper, we propose a set of patterns for modeling the operational control mechanisms, organized by classes of control questions that all DELS must be able to answer. The pattern for each control question includes an analysis-agnostic functional definition of the control problem for that question, as well as a mapping of the decision variable in that problem to a particular function and execution mechanism in the base system.},

abstract = {The Adaptive Multi-scale Prognostics and Health Management (AM-PHM) is a methodology designed to enable PHM in smart manufacturing systems. In application, PHM information is not yet fully utilized in higher-level decision-making in manufacturing systems. AM-PHM leverages and integrates lower-level PHM information such as from a machine or component with hierarchical relationships across the component, machine, work cell, and assembly line levels in a manufacturing system. The AM-PHM methodology enables the creation of actionable prognostic and diagnostic intelligence up and down the manufacturing process hierarchy. Decisions are then made with the knowledge of the current and projected health state of the system at decision points along the nodes of the hierarchical structure. To overcome the issue of exponential explosion of complexity associated with describing a large manufacturing system, the AM-PHM methodology takes a hierarchical Markov Decision Process (MDP) approach into describing the system and solving for an optimized policy. A description of the AM-PHM methodology is followed by a simulated industry-inspired example to demonstrate the effectiveness of AM-PHM.},

abstract = {Model-Based Systems Engineering is founded on the principle of a unified system model that can coordinate architecture, mechanical, electrical, software, verification, and other discipline-specific models across the system lifecycle. This vision of a Total System Model as the digital blueprint (or digital twin) of a system, federating models in multiple vendor tools and configuration-controlled repositories, has gained tremendous support from the practitioners. A software platform, Syndeia, developed by Intercax, provides capabilities for seamless model-based communication between systems engineering and X (where X = mechanical/electrical, simulation, PLM, ALM, project management, and other disciplines), replacing the existing document-centric approaches. This paper elaborates research and development performed by NASA JPL and Intercax for integrating system architecture models (SysML) and mechanical design models (CAD) with applications to the Europa Clipper Mission. Specifically, this paper demonstrates (1) seeding of mechanical design models from system specifications (SysML) as a starting point for mechanical design, (2) model-based connections between system and mechanical design parameters, including compare and bi-directional synchronization, (3) abstracting system architecture from mechanical assemblies for transitioning existing/old projects to a model-based systems approach, and (4) use of persistent, fine-grained connections between system architecture and mechanical design models for continuous verification and communication between the two disciplines. The paper also covers organizational, cultural, and technical challenges that need to be addressed for seamless integration between system architecture models and mechanical/electrical design models, as well as other disciplines. 2016, American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics Inc, AIAA.

@article{Banker1984,
abstract = {In management contexts, mathematical programming is usually used to evaluate a collection of possible alternative courses of action en route to selecting one which is best. In this capacity, mathematical programming serves as a planning aid to management. Data Envelopment Analysis reverses this role and employs mathematical programming to obtain ex post facto evaluations of the relative efficiency of management accomplishments, however they may have been planned or executed. Mathematical programming is thereby extended for use as a tool for control and evaluation of past accomplishments as well as a tool to aid in planning future activities. The CCR ratio form introduced by Charnes, Cooper and Rhodes, as part of their Data Envelopment Analysis approach, comprehends both technical and scale inefficiencies via the optimal value of the ratio form, as obtained directly from the data without requiring a priori specification of weights and/or explicit delineation of assumed functional forms of relations between inputs and outputs. A separation into technical and scale efficiencies is accomplished by the methods developed in this paper without altering the latter conditions for use of DEA directly on observational data. Technical inefficiencies are identified with failures to achieve best possible output levels and/or usage of excessive amounts of inputs. Methods for identifying and correcting the magnitudes of these inefficiencies, as supplied in prior work, are illustrated. In the present paper, a new separate variable is introduced which makes it possible to determine whether operations were conducted in regions of increasing, constant or decreasing returns to scale (in multiple input and multiple output situations). The results are discussed and related not only to classical (single output) economics but also to more modern versions of economics which are identified with “contestable market theories.”},

abstract = {Complex, cyber-physical systems must be founded on a digital blueprint that provides the most accurate representation of the system by federating information from engineering models across multiple enterprise repositories. This blueprint would serve as the digital surrogate of the system and evolve as the actual system matures across its lifecycle, from conception and design to production and operations. This paper presents a graph-based approach for realizing the digital blueprint, which we refer to as the Total System Model. The paper is divided into five parts. Part 1 provides an introduction to use cases for model-based systems engineering. Part 2 introduces graph concepts for the Total System Model. Part 3 provides a demonstration of the graph-based approach using Syndeia software as a representative application. Part 4 provides a summary of this paper, and Part 5 lays out potential directions for future work. The complexity in modern systems is growing at an unprecedented pace. This complexity arises from a range of factors such as increasing number and types of system components, increasing types of interfaces and interactions between system components, availability of system functionality outside the system boundaries, and increasing interactions with the operating environment (system-of-systems, internet-of-things). Most mechanical and electrical hardware-dominated systems have increasingly become cyber-physical in nature. This complexity challenges the organizations developing modern systems that must now be equipped with advanced software and hardware tools to support the system through its lifecycle—design, manufacturing, operations, and maintenance— and must also respond to rapidly evolving market forces and competition for new and improved systems.},

abstract = {Purpose - The purpose of this research is to determine how project managers attribute information technology (IT) project success and failure. Design/methodology/approach - IT personnel from large Australian organisations completed an adapted version of the Attributional Styles questionnaire, which asked them to attribute causes along a number of attribution dimensions, for IT projects which have either succeeded or failed. Findings - The results indicate that IT support workers attribute failure to external factors, whilst attributing success to themselves. On the other hand, executive management took a more balanced perspective which attribute success to external factors and only partially to themselves, whereas they attribute significant personal responsibility for failure. Practical implications - More junior professionals and operational IT employees can learn from their senior professionals in attributing success and failure. Post-implementation reviews and debriefings conducted by senior IT professionals are ways of passing on their experience in relation to project and self-evaluations. Originality/value - This paper takes a well established psychology theory and applies it to the management of information systems (IS)/IT projects. IS/IT research has not examined how IT professionals attribute success and failure within projects. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]},

The repository is designed to contain (1) unit manufacturing process performance models, (2) composite performance models representing production cells, lines, and facilities, (3) domain specific analytical views, and (4) ontologies and taxonomies. Initial implementation includes performance models for milling and drilling as well as a composite performance model for machining. These performance models formally capture (1) the metrics of energy consumption, CO2 emissions, tool wear, and cost as a function of process controls and parameters, and (2) the process feasibility constraints. The initial scope of the system includes (1) an Integrated Development Environment and its interface, and (2) simulation and deterministic optimization of performance models through the use of Unity Decision Guidance Management System.},

In case of any technical modifications of machines the technical documentation also has to be updated. In fact these updates are lacking in most cases. In this paper, the authors propose a methodology for a self-organized creation of technical documentation to enable an up to date state throughout the Product Life Cycle. A complete and up to date technical documentation provides benefits to customers as well as suppliers of manufacturing facilities. The new approach is based on integration and communication of all components and modules such as machine tool, transportation and handling technology etc. via “Cyber Physical Systems”.},

In doing so it illustrates the processes of discovering practical and relevant knowledge from pathology request data generated and stored in a professional pathology company, investigates and understands the decision makers (GPs) through a survey about their current practices in test ordering and their requirements for decision support, and finally proposes an intelligent decision support framework as the decision strategy to support GPs in ordering pathology tests more effectively and appropriately.

Existing research based on either group technology or fixed modeling matching algorithms, impose a priori categorization schemes on engineering data or require significant human labeling of design data. This paper describes a general technique for ?teaching? existing model comparison algorithms to adapt to different classifications that are relevant in many engineering applications. In this way, the core shape matching algorithms can be learned to adapt to wide variety of model classifications based on user input and training data. This allows for great flexibility in search and data mining of engineering data. Results are presented that show how to optimize different parameters to fit different categorization schema. The paper presents a comprehensive example and provides empirical results using a nearest neighbor classification on mechanical CAD models from the National Design Repository.},

abstract = {For sustained competitive advantage of established process manufacturing firms, technological process innovation to improve resource productivity and environmental performance has become of pivotal importance. These firms, however, often face intra-organizational tensions to reconcile pressures for exploration and exploitation across subsequent phases of technological process innovation. Firms may, therefore, need to perform the development phase – being the most sensitive to these tensions – in the inter-organizational context of an external dedicated development facility. This requires new-to-the-firm management activities, i.e., management innovation. However, the role of management innovation in enabling technological process innovation in an inter-organizational context remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, in developing propositions we use illustrative examples from the research context of an external development facility for sustainable process technology. The paper has two contributions. First, by adopting a process perspective we are able to clarify how both types of innovation are combined over time in an intertwined way. Second, we extend management innovation theory by conceptualizing management innovation in an inter-organizational context. We conclude with implications for theory, practice and future research.},

abstract = {This paper reviews the growing body of research that explores ‘the social shaping of technology' (SST) — how the design and implementation of technology are patterned by a range of ‘social' and ‘economic' factors as well as narrowly ‘technical' considerations. It shows how researchers from a range of disciplinary backgrounds were brought together by a critique of traditional conceptions of technology (for example, ‘linear models' of innovation that privileged technological supply or restricted the scope of social inquiry into technology to assessing its ‘impacts'). Though their analytical frameworks differ to a greater or lesser extent in terminology and approach, some explanatory concepts have emerged, and constitute an effective model of the innovation process. Here, it is suggested, SST offers a deeper understanding and also potentially broadens the technology policy agenda. These claims are assessed through a review of recent research into specific instances of social shaping, particularly in relation to information technology. Finally the article discusses some of the intellectual dilemmas in the field. Though the intellectual cross-fertilisation has been creative, points of tension and divergence between its constituent strands have resulted in some sharp controversies, which reflect upon the theoretical and policy claims of SST.},

abstract = {The past three decades have seen phenomenal growth in investments in the area of product lifecycle management (PLM) as companies exploit opportunities in streamlining product lifecycle processes, and fully harnessing their data assets. These processes span all product lifecycle phases from requirements definition, systems design/ analysis, and simulation, detailed design, manufacturing planning, production planning, quality management, customer support, in-service management, and end-of-life recycling. Initiatives ranging from process re-engineering, enterprise-level change management, standardization, globalization and the like have moved PLM processes to mission-critical enterprise systems. Product data representations that encapsulate semantics to support product data exchange and PLM collaboration processes have driven several standards organizations, vendor product development efforts, real-world PLM implementations, and research initiatives. However, the process and deployment dimensions have attracted little attention: The need to optimize organization processes rather than individual benefits poses challenging “culture change management” issues and have derailed many enterprise-scale PLM efforts. Drawn from the authors' field experiences as PLM system integrators, business process consultants, corporate executives, vendors, and academicians, this paper explores the broad scope of PLM, with an added focus on the implementation and deployment of PLM beyond the development of technology. We review the historical evolution of engineering information management/PLM systems and processes, characterize PLM implementations and solution contexts, and discuss case studies from multiple industries. We conclude with a discussion of research issues motivated by improving PLM adoption in industry.},

abstract = {The manufacturing industry is evolving and starting to use 3D models as the central knowledge artifact for product data and product definition, or what is known as Model-based Definition (MBD). The Model-based Enterprise (MBE) uses MBD as a way to transition away from using traditional paperbased drawings and documentation. As MBD grows in popularity, it is imperative to understand what information is needed in the transition from drawings to models so that models represent all the relevant information needed for processes to continue efficiently. Finding this information can help define what data is common amongst different models in different stages of the lifecycle, which could help establish a Common Information Model. The Common Information Model is a source that contains common information from domain specific elements amongst different aspects of the lifecycle. To help establish this Common Information Model, information about how models are used in industry within different workflows needs to be understood. To retrieve this information, a survey mechanism was administered to industry professionals from various sectors. Based on the results of the survey a Common Information Model could not be established. However, the results gave great insight that will help in further investigation of the Common Information Model.},

@article{Morrow2014,
abstract = {Researchers in decision-based design (DBD) have suggested that business objectives, e.g., profits, should replace engineering requirements or performance metrics as the objective for engineering design. This requires modeling market performance, including consumer preferences and competition between firms. Game-theoretic "design-then-pricing" models-i.e., product design anticipating future price competition-provide an important framework for integrating consumer preferences and competition when design decisions must be made before prices are decided by a firm or by its competitors. This article concerns computational optimization in a design-then-pricing model. We argue that some approaches may be fundamentally difficult for existing solvers and propose a method that exhibits both improved efficiency and reliability relative to existing methods. Numerical results for a vehicle design example validate our theoretical arguments and examine the impact of anticipating pricing competition on design decisions. We find that anticipating pricing competition, while potentially important for accurately forecasting profits, does not necessarily have a significant effect on optimal design decisions. Most existing examples suggest otherwise, anticipating competition in prices is important to choosing optimal designs. Our example differs in the importance of design constraints, that reduce the influence the market model has on optimal designs.},

@article{Ceret2013,
abstract = {CONTEXT Designers and developers are increasingly expected to deliver high quality systems, i.e. systems that are usable, robust, consistent as well as evolutionary, and that fulfill users' needs. To produce such systems, Design Methods suggest many approaches. However, the important number of existing approaches makes the choice of a method among the others particularly difficult. In addition to this, and because of the time required for understanding (and then operationalizing) new methods, designers tend to use already known methods, even though those which sometimes may not really be adapted to their needs. OBJECTIVE This paper proposes a classification of characteristics of design methods process models. In other terms, it proposes a taxonomy that aims to facilitate the discovery and the choice of methods for designers and developers. METHOD From a study of process models of several design methods, we identify six main axes, namely Cycle, Collaboration, Artifacts, Recommended Use, Maturity and Flexibility, which are in turn divided into 34 characteristics. RESULTS This paper provides a deep theorical insight. For each characteristic identified from relevant literature, a definition and a gradation, illustrated using examples, are given. Moreover, it presents a web site that offers various tools for exploring the axes of our taxonomy. This web site provides an overview of process models as well as means for comparing them, textually or graphically. Finally, the paper relates the first evaluation conducted in order to estimate designers' adhesion to the taxonomy in terms of easiness of learning, completeness and intention to use. CONCLUSION We show, based on evaluation results, that our taxonomy of process models facilitates the discovery of new methods and helps designers in choosing suitable methods, really adapted to their needs. Therefore, it enhances chances to conduct high quality projects.},

abstract = {This paper will explore how product robustness can be improved by incorporating end-user decision making in the early design stages of complex multi-disciplinary products. The end-user decision making will be incorporated into the product design models through novel decision and game theory methods. Improvement of product robustness using these models will be shown through the use of three example products. The product's robustness will be represented by the variations of the product's performance due to the variations of the end-users. These variations of performance will be captured numerically through the performance's standard deviation. One of the examples, the complex product of a building, will be examined in-depth through the Vacate-GT evacuation simulator. Vacate-GT is an evacuation simulator that incorporates the mathematical methods of decision and game theory to determine the decisions of evacuees in the exit and velocity decision making process. Monte Carlo simulations will be performed on multiple building designs to determine their robustness to variations of the end-users. These simulations will showcase how designs can be optimized in the early design stages to be more robust to variations in the end-user population. This paper will prove that the use of decision and game theories to incorporate end-user uncertainties into models enables the designer to create more robust products. 2012 by B. L. Mesmer and C. L.

abstract = {Cyber-Physical System (CPS) is a new trend in the Internet-of-Things (IoT) related research works, where physical systems act as the sensors to collect real-world information and communicate them to the computation modules (i.e. cyber layer), which further analyze and notify the findings to the corresponding physical systems through a feedback loop. Contemporary researchers recommend integrating cloud technologies in the CPS cyber layer to ensure scalability of storage, computation and cross domain communication capabilities. Though there exist a few descriptive models of the cloud-based CPS architecture, it is important to analytically describe the key CPS properties: computation, control, and communication. In this paper, we present a digital twin architecture reference model for the cloud-based CPS, C2PS, where we analytically describe the key properties of the C2PS. The model helps in identifying various degrees of basic and hybrid computation-interaction modes in this paradigm. We have designed C2PS smart interaction controller using a Bayesian belief network so that the system dynamically considers current contexts. The composition of fuzzy rule base with the Bayes network further enables the system with reconfiguration capability. We also describe analytically, how C2PS subsystem communications can generate even more complex system-ofsystems. Later, we present a telematics-based prototype driving assistance application for the vehicular domain of C2PS, VCPS, to demonstrate the efficacy of the architecture reference model.},

abstract = {Engineering design reconciles design constraints with decision maker (DM) preferences. The task of eliciting and encoding decision maker preferences is, however, extremely difficult. A Pareto front representing the locus of the nondominated designs is, therefore, often generated to help a decision maker select the best design. In this paper, we show that this method has a shortcoming when there is uncertainty in both the decision problem variables and in the model of decision maker's preferences. In this case, the Pareto front is inconsistent with multi-attribute utility (MAU) theory, unless the decision maker trades off attributes or some functions of them linearly. This is a strong restriction. To account for this, we propose a methodology that enables a decision maker to select the best design on a modified pareto front (MPF) which is acquired using envelopes of a set of certainty equivalent (CE) surfaces. The proposed method does not require separability of the multi-attribute utility function into single-attribute utilities, nor does it require the decision maker to trade the attributes (or any function of them) linearly. We demonstrate our approach on a simple optimization problem and in design of a reduction gear.},

abstract = {Combining multiple sensors on CMMs (Coordinate Measuring Machines) is useful to fulfil the increasing requirements on both complexity and accuracy in dimensional metrology. Yet, the methodology to plan measurement strategies for systems combining different types of sensors is still a major challenge. Such planning is commonly done in an interactive way. This paper presents a methodology which can create inspection plans automatically for CMM inspection combining a touch trigger probe and a laser scanner. The inspection features are specified based on the extracted geometry features and the associated PMI (Product and Manufacturing Information) items from a CAD model. A knowledge based sensor selection method is applied to choose the suited sensor for each inspection feature. For touch trigger measurements, the sampling strategy considers the measurement uncertainty calculated by simulation. A geometry-guide method is developed for collision-free probing path generation. For laser scan measurements, the required view angles and positions of the laser scanner are determined iteratively, based on which the scan path is generated automatically. The proposed methodology is tested for several cases and validated by measurement experiments. The methodology provides suited planning results and can be used for automated dimensional inspection, i.e. Computer Aided Quality Control (CAQC).},

abstract = {The ability to search for a CAD model that represents a specific physical part is a useful capability that can be used in many different applications. This paper presents an approach to use partial 3D point cloud of an artifact for retrieving the CAD model of the artifact. We assume that the information about the physical parts will be captured by a single 3D scan that produces dense point clouds. CAD models in our approach are represented as polygonal meshes. Our approach involves segmenting the point cloud and CAD mesh models into surface patches. The next step is to identify corresponding surface patches in point clouds and CAD models that could potentially match. Finally, we compute transformations to align the point cloud to the CAD model and compute distance between them. We also present experimental results to show that our approach can be used to retrieve CAD models of mechanical parts.

abstract = {Management literature has suggested that contextual factors may present strong inertial forces within organizations that inhibit implementations that appear technically rational [R.R. Nelson, S.G. Winter, An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, MA, 1982]. This paper examines the effects of three contextual factors, plant size, plant age and unionization status, on the likelihood of implementing 22 manufacturing practices that are key facets of lean production systems. Further, we postulate four “bundles” of inter-related and internally consistent practices; these are just-in-time (JIT), total quality management (TQM), total preventive maintenance (TPM), and human resource management (HRM). We empirically validate our bundles and investigate their effects on operational performance. The study sample uses data from IndustryWeek's Census of Manufacturers. The evidence provides strong support for the influence of plant size on lean implementation, whereas the influence of unionization and plant age is less pervasive than conventional wisdom suggests. The results also indicate that lean bundles contribute substantially to the operating performance of plants, and explain about 23{\%} of the variation in operational performance after accounting for the effects of industry and contextual factors.},

abstract = {System affordability is a growing concern in the design and development of civilian, military, and commercial complex engineered systems. Schedule delays, cost overruns, and performance shortfalls are often default outcomes of such developments. In recent years, research efforts have been focused on exploring the solution space more effectively to find better solutions. However, industry and governmental organizations have not yet been able to apply those techniques to their full potential. The present dissertation asserts that the size of the solution space relates to the probability of finding affordable solutions. As a result, the effectiveness of tradespace exploration techniques is limited by the size of the solution space. Recognizing that system requirements restrict the solution space, this research creates models to elicit requirements that could facilitate the maximization of the solution space for a given set of stakeholder needs. As a result, the probability of finding more affordable solutions during tradespace-exploration is also maximized. This research contributes to the body of knowledge of systems engineering and to its state of the art in three areas: systems theory, complexity science, and systems engineering methods. First, a set of definitions, theorems, and corollaries formally prove how stakeholder needs, system requirements, solution spaces, and system affordability are related. Second, the concept of problem complexity and an analytical framework to sum up different types of complexities are developed. Problem complexity measures the lower bound of complexity a system could achieve, given a set of requirements. Third, two methods to reduce such complexity during requirements elicitation are developed. The first method, inspired in Max-Neef's model of human needs, facilitates the identification of constraints that limit the solution space without supporting the satisfaction of new needs. The second method, based on the concept of elementary decomposition, facilitates the identification of conflicting requirements and enables challenging decisions at higher levels of the architecture. Research hypotheses are validated by a combination of mathematical proof, case studies, and field tests. The results of the present research are generalized to discrete requirements, fuzzy requirements, and continuous requirements or value functions.},

In amarket, units of capacity, represented as manufacturing services, can be acquired as needed and when needed, thus making supply chains more responsive to fluctuations in supply and demand. Although Manufacturing Market can be built physically as a spot market, its benefits can be better realized in a web-based framework. We refer to the web-based version of Manufacturing Market as DigitalManufacturingMarket (DMM). The major challenges in deployment of a virtual market for manufacturing services include standard representation of manufacturing needs and capabilities, incorporation of intelligent supplier search and evaluation mechanism, and automation of supply chain configuration process. This paper introduces DMMthrough its major components including amulti-agent framework, a formal ontology for representation ofmanufacturing services as well as a matchmaking methodology used for connecting buyers and sellers of manufacturing services based on their semantic similarities. The ultimate goal of the proposed framework is to enable autonomous deployment of manufacturing supply chains based on the specific technological requirements defined by particular work orders.

@article{Fernandes2011,
abstract = {In this paper, we present a metric based on semantic relatedness which operates on semantic knowledge representations of engineering design and show how it can support design innovation. Our semantic knowledge representation is composed of an ontology representing design concepts using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) functional basis formalism. We assert that the uniqueness of a design concept is directly proportional to the mean semantic distance between itself and the set of competing design concepts represented as instances within our functional basis ontology. This leads to our Semantic Relatedness Uniqueness Metric called SeRUM. SeRUM draws upon semantic functional model representations of design concepts and computer science semantic relatedness techniques. SeRUM provides design teams a measure of their effectiveness in terms of generating unique design concepts. To highlight SeRUM's application in engineering design innovation, a design innovation case study is detailed and the results are discussed. 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

Numerous large scale engineered systems face schedule delays, cost overruns and performance shortfalls that can be traced back to the requirements they need to fulfill. In fact, previous research has demonstrated strong relationship between requirements and systems affordability. This paper summarizes and puts into context the authors' novel contributions in three domains of requirements engineering: systems theory, complexity science, and systems methodologies. The authors propose new theorems and their proofs on requirements affecting affordability, propose a new complexity metric at requirement stage that measures the complexity limit of the system at conceptual stage (even before a specific design is determined), and propose two methodologies to elicit excess-free requirement sets and to identify conflicting requirements more effectively. The paper showcases the value of structuring a research in such a manner, i.e. from theory to practice, enabling strengthening the bounds between theorists and practitioners.},

The proposed model does not bear any ambition of being exhaustive: the main objective of this paper is to propose a model of goal dynamics in which Goal Setting, Management by Objectives and Training are viewed as human resource practices able to enhance workers' goal commitment, and therefore, improve organizational performance. In the first part of this paper, an analysis of the Goal Setting Theory and the role of goal setting practices, in bettering worker's performance, are stressed. In the second part, a case-study, the causal loop and a quantitative model of goal dynamics in organizations are described. In the third part, behaviour reproduction testing, optimization analysis for parameter estimation and scenario analysis are presented. Limitations of the present research and conclusions are finally discussed.},

Since about ten years, new design methods have been proposed to consider early functionalities and tolerance specifications but no one clearly integrates the product modelling stage. To handle assemblies with thousands of parts with many functional requirements, we have defined a functional design method that early helps to identify and analyse functional geometrical entities and tolerance specifications. The proposed method integrates GASAP, a new approach for modelling as soon as possible parts, assembly and tolerance specifications in a CAD system. The method is supported by GAIA, a new software tool built on assembly-nested graphs.},

abstract = {The economics of the multi-pass turning problem is considered, while accounting for tool life uncertainty. The goal is to minimise the expected production cost per part, given the probability distribution for tool life, and with machining parameters being subject to practical constraints. The cost function accounts for machining cost, idling cost, tool changing cost as well as the cost associated with tool failure. A modified version of the particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm, called the dynamic objective PSO (or DOPSO), is used for minimisation of the cost function. The decision variables include not only the machining parameters but also the tool replacement time. The equality constraint that the total desired depth of cut be achieved by an integral number of roughing passes and a single finishing pass is handled in a novel way, and together with including tool replacement time as a decision variable, this leads to lower costs than those cited by other comparable previous works. To handle uncertain constraints that lead to part failure when violated (e.g. desired surface finish), a robust formulation is also suggested through similar incorporation in the cost function, as for tool failure. 2011 Taylor Francis.},

abstract = {AbstractThe design of large complex systems, such as warehouses, requires multiple experts and analyses as well as methods to organise and integrate their knowledge. While there are many models for optimising individual aspects of warehouses, there is not, today, a comprehensive design methodology that incorporates and supports all of the design decisions and provides a method to effectively integrate the solutions to these subproblems into a complete warehouse system specification. In this research, we propose a hierarchical design decision support methodology based on decomposing the design problem into a set of subproblems and using a formal model of the system to integrate the solutions to these subproblems. The methodology enables a thorough search of the design space and the identification of many candidate designs for consideration by the design decision maker. The hierarchical design methodology is demonstrated with an example of designing a forward pick area.},

abstract = {This study provides a sensitivity analysis of water distribution systems using Sobol's method, with the intent of improving the optimisation procedure for complex design problems. Generally, sensitivity analysis can enhance optimal design by reducing the size of search spaces, guiding the optimisation process, identifying the most appropriate system performance metrics, and determining the key uncertainty sources in the case of stochastic design. Sobol's method is a global sensitivity analysis method that provides detailed information on main parameter effects and their interactions. Two Sobol sensitivity indices (first-order and total-order indices) are computed using the Latin Hypercube sampling method. Sensitivities have been quantified for a number of different performance metrics, including total pressure deficit, maximum pressure deficit, minimum surplus pressure, resilience, probabilistic robustness, and a specific risk measure. Two case studies are investigated: the New York Tunnels network and the Anytown network. Results show that different metrics have a distinctive response to different decision variables, highlighting the need for careful selection of the metrics in the design process. Significant interactions exist between different variables when analyzing risk and resilience in the case of New York Tunnels network, and for the minimum surplus head in the case of Anytown network. In addition, a large portion of decision variables have little impact on many of the metrics, offering a possible reduction of search space size when solving the optimal design problem. 2012 ASCE.},

abstract = {This paper explores the trends in the deployment and integration of distributed generation in Germany, Denmark and Sweden. The study concentrates on the regulation of renewable energy generation with a focus on grid access and connection mechanisms. The high rate of distributed generation penetration is mainly based on the early support that these countries gave to the expansion of renewable energy generation – mainly wind and solar – within their respective national policies. Germany and Denmark are the ones with the most sophisticated support schemes, which have shown a dynamic design over time. In terms of connections, Germany has the most favorable connection regime which provides not only priority connection but also priority grid access for generation units that produce electricity from renewable energy sources. Sweden guarantees equal treatment among different technologies (i.e. a non-discrimination principle). High connection costs have been observed specially in Germany and Denmark. The costs of network upgrades are usually socialised across demand customers. However, integration issues should be taken into consideration in order to avoid expansion of distributed generation in a way which unnecessarily raises total system costs, via high connection costs.},

abstract = {This paper presents a five-phase taxonomy of systematic procedures to enable flexibility in the design and management of engineering systems operating under uncertainty. The taxonomy integrates contributions from surveys, individual articles, and books from the literature on engineering design, manufacturing, product development, and real options analysis obtained from professional e-index search engines. Thirty design procedures were classified based on the kind of early conceptual activities they support: baseline design, uncertainty recognition, concept generation, design space exploration, and process management. Each procedure is evaluated based on ease of use to enable flexibility analysis, whether it can be used directly in collaborative design activities, and has a proven applicability record in industry and research. The organizing principles integrate the procedures into a cohesive and systematic design framework. Demonstration applications on engineering systems case studies show that it helps designers select relevant procedures in different phases of the design process, depending on the context, available analytical resources, and objectives. In turn, the case studies show that the design framework helps generate concepts with improved lifecycle performance compared to baseline concepts. The taxonomy provides guidance to organize ongoing research efforts, and highlights potential contribution areas in this field of engineering design research.},

@article{Li2014,
abstract = {In this paper, we develop a comprehensive real-time interactive framework for the utility and customers in a smart grid while ensuring grid-stability and quality-of-service (QoS). First, we propose a hierarchical architecture for the utility-customer interaction consisting of sub-components of customer load prediction, renewable generation integration, power-load balancing and demand response (DR). Within this hierarchical architecture, we focus on the problem of real-time scheduling in an abstract grid model consisting of one controller and multiple customer units. A scalable solution to the real-time scheduling problem is proposed by combining solutions to two sub-problems: ({\$}1{\$} ) centralized sequential decision making at the controller to maximize an accumulated reward for the whole micro-grid and ({\$}2{\$} ) distributed auctioning among all customers based on the optimal load profile obtained by solving the first problem to coordinate their interactions. We formulate the centralized sequential decision making at the controller as a hidden mode Markov decision process (HM-MDP). Next, a Vikrey auctioning game is designed to coordinate the actions of the individual smart-homes to actually achieve the optimal solution derived by the controller under realistic gird interaction assumptions. We show that though truthful bidding is a weakly dominant strategy for all smart-homes in the auctioning game, collusive equilibria do exist and can jeopardize the effectiveness and efficiency of the trading opportunity allocation. Analysis on the structure of the Bayesian Nash equilibrium solution set shows that the Vickrey auctioning game can be made more robust against collusion by customers (anticipating distributed smart-homes) by introducing a positive reserve price. The corresponding auctioning game is then shown to converge to the unique incentive compatible truthful bidding Bayesian Nash equilibrium, without jeopardizing the auctioneer's (microgrid controller's) profit. The paper also explicitly discusses how this two-step solution approach can be scaled to be suitable for more complicated smart grid architectures beyond the assumed abstract model.},

abstract = {Currently, expectations from Internet of Things (IoT) are extremely high worldwide. However, mechanical engineers working on product design processes do not always benefit. This paper utilizes the up-to-date IoT-enabled commercial product lifecycle management (PLM) system to examine the effectiveness of IoT value for mechanical engineers. Moreover, it discusses the maturity model for digital engineering for the new era of IoT. Furthermore, this paper introduces significant initiatives such as a PLM functionality connected to everything, monitoring of field data for getting back to design process, and virtual 3D data and real field data superposition. This paper concludes that there is high potential to use IoT technology for mechanical engineers from the perspective of quality and reliability design innovations.},

Mind you, not computer scientists but programmers — engineers rather than scientists. I know this sounds crazy and I am properly scared. I can't deny that there is a huge gap between science and engineering because I have worked on both sides of the divide. But I've always felt a very strong compulsion to explain things. I have tremendous admiration for Richard Feynman who was the master of simple explanations. I know I'm no Feynman, but I will try my best.

Increased product complexity, distributed authoring environments, and the need for tighter team integration with partners and suppliers have created challenges and new opportunities for information technology (IT) vendors to be able to integrate systems from multiple independent software vendors (ISVs) to form a coherent Enterprise PDM system. This paper will describe, in detail, a case study and solution of an IBM Research project called Hedwig. Hedwig investigates creating robust solutions for Product Life-Cycle Management (PLM). We focus on several research issues, including information federation, data mapping, synchronization, and web services connections. We describe a working system that allows access to several heterogeneous PDM systems that are used in the automotive and aerospace industries.},

@article{Medina2014,
abstract = {Robust design optimization (RDO) is a popular framework for addressing uncertainties in the design of engineering systems by considering different statistical measures, typically the mean and standard deviation of the system response. RDO can lead to a wide range of different candidate designs, establishing a different compromise between these competing objectives. This work introduces a new robustness measure, termed probability of dominance, for assessing the appropriateness of each candidate design. This measure is defined as the likelihood that a particular design will outperform the rival designs within a candidate set. Furthermore, a multi-stage implementation is introduced to facilitate increased versatility/confidence in the decision-making process by considering the comparison among smaller subsets within the initial larger set of candidate designs. For enhancing the robustness in these comparisons the impact of prediction errors, introduced to address potential differences between the real (i.e. as built) system and the numerical model adopted for it, is also addressed. This extends to proper modeling of the influence of the prediction error, including selection of its probability model, as well as evaluation of its impact on the probability of dominance and on the RDO formulation itself. Two illustrative examples are presented, the first considering the design of a tuned mass damper (TMD) for vibration mitigation of harmonic excitations and the second a topology optimization problem for minimum compliance. Extensive comparisons are presented in these two examples and the discussions demonstrate the power of the proposed approach for assessing the designs robustness. 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg},

abstract = {Industry has been chasing the dream of integrating and linking data across the product lifecycle and enterprises for decades. However, industry has been challenged by the fact that the context in which data are used varies based on the function/role in the product lifecycle that is interacting with the data. Holistically, the data across the product lifecycle must be considered an unstructured data set because multiple data repositories and domain-specific schema exist in each phase of the lifecycle. This paper explores a concept called the lifecycle information framework and technology (LIFT). LIFT is a conceptual framework for lifecycle information management and the integration of emerging and existing technologies, which together form the basis of a research agenda for dynamic information modeling in support of digital-data curation and reuse in manufacturing. This paper provides a discussion of the existing technologies and activities that the LIFT concept leverages. Also, the paper describes the motivation for applying such work to the domain of manufacturing. Then, the LIFT concept is discussed in detail, while underlying technologies are further examined and a use case is detailed. Lastly, potential impacts are explored.},

abstract = {Automated classification of artifacts produced by mechanical computer-aided design (CAD) is a unique research frontier for 3D matching and mesh processing. Unlike general graphical models, mechanical CAD artifacts have a physical realization via a variety of manufacturing processes as well as functional and behavioral attributes. The general problem of how to best correlate low-level shape data with the higher-order manufacturing and mechanical properties remains an open area of research with many practical applications (cost estimation, design archival, variational design and process selection). This paper addresses the problem of manufacturing process discrimination, i.e., determination of the best (or most likely) manufacturing process from shape feature information. Specifically, we introduce a new curvature-based shape descriptor and show its applicability to manufacturing process discrimination using a publicly available set of artifacts from the National Design Repository. Statistics on surface curvatures are used to construct the curvature-based shape descriptor; and a supervised machine learning classifier, based on support vector machines, is applied to learn a separator for models that are “prismatic machined” and “cast-then-machined”. The authors believe that this work can be the basis for practical new techniques for manufacturing cost estimation, engineering analysis and design archival.},

abstract = {This book offers a systematic introduction to the optimal stochastic control theory via the dynamic programming principle, which is a powerful tool to analyze control problems. First we consider completely observable control problems with finite horizons. Using a time discretization we construct a nonlinear semigroup related to the dynamic programming principle (DPP), whose generator provides the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, and we characterize the value function via the nonlinear semigroup, besides the viscosity solution theory. When we control not only the dynamics of a system but also the terminal time of its evolution, control-stopping problems arise. This problem is treated in the same frameworks, via the nonlinear semigroup. Its results are applicable to the American option price problem. Zero-sum two-player time-homogeneous stochastic differential games and viscosity solutions of the Isaacs equations arising from such games are studied via a nonlinear semigroup related to DPP (the min-max principle, to be precise). Using semi-discretization arguments, we construct the nonlinear semigroups whose generators provide lower and upper Isaacs equations. Concerning partially observable control problems, we refer to stochastic parabolic equations driven by colored Wiener noises, in particular, the Zakai equation. The existence and uniqueness of solutions and regularities as well as It{\^{o}}'s formula are stated. A control problem for the Zakai equations has a nonlinear semigroup whose generator provides the HJB equation on a Banach space. The value function turns out to be a unique viscosity solution for the HJB equation under mild conditions. This edition provides a more generalized treatment of the topic than does the earlier book Lectures on Stochastic Control Theory (ISI Lecture Notes 9), where time-homogeneous cases are dealt with. Here, for finite time-horizon control problems, DPP was formulated as a one-parameter nonlinear semigroup, whose generator provides the HJB equation, by using a time-discretization method. The semigroup corresponds to the value function and is characterized as the envelope of Markovian transition semigroups of responses for constant control processes.

abstract = {Machine learning (ML) (a subset of artificial intelligence that focuses on autonomous computer knowledge gain) is actively being used across many domains, such as entertainment, commerce, and increasingly in industrial settings. The wide applicability and low barriers for development of these algorithms are allowing for innovations, once thought unattainable, to be realized in an ever more digital world. As these innovations continue across industries, the manufacturing industry has also begun to gain benefits. With the current push for Smart Manufacturing and Industrie 4.0, ML for manufacturing is experiencing unprecedented levels of interest; but how much is industry actually using these highly-publicized techniques? This paper sorts through a decade of manufacturing publications to quantify the amount of effort being put towards advancing ML in manufacturing. This work identifies both prominent areas of ML use, and popular algorithms. This also allows us to highlight any gaps, or areas where ML could play a vital role. To maximize the search space utilization of this investigation, ML based Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques were employed to rapidly sort through a vast corpus of engineering documents to identify key areas of research and application, as well as uncover documents most pertinent to this survey. The salient outcome of this research is the presentation of current focus areas and gaps in ML applications to the manufacturing industry, with particular emphasis on cross domain knowledge utilization. A full detailing of methods and findings is presented.},

abstract = {Optimal control theory is the science of maximizing the returns from and minimizing the costs of the operation of physical, social, and economic processes. Geared toward upper-level undergraduates, this text introduces three aspects of optimal control theory: dynamic programming, Pontryagin's minimum principle, and numerical techniques for trajectory optimization.Chapters 1 and 2 focus on describing systems and evaluating their performances. Chapter 3 deals with dynamic programming. The calculus of variations and Pontryagin's minimum principle are the subjects of chapters 4 and 5, and chapter 6 examines iterative numerical techniques for finding optimal controls and trajectories. Numerous problems, intended to introduce additional topics as well as to illustrate basic concepts, appear throughout the text.},

The Airframe Digital Twin is a tail number specific computational model of an individual aircraft. It has the potential to improve the way U.S. Air Force aircraft are managed over their entire lifecycle by creating individualized structural management plans. The Airframe Digital Twin can provide configuration control for each aircraft in the inventory. Through computational simulations performed with an Airframe Digital Twin, it can serve as a virtual health sensor, and provide a forecast of future maintenance needs for an individual aircraft. The Airframe Digital Twin concept is considered possible because of advances in high performance computing. An essential part of the Airframe Digital Twin is the ability to reduce the uncertainty in the model with increasing service experience through Bayesian updating.},

abstract = {In data envelopment analysis, there are several methods for measuring efficiency changes over time, e.g. the window analysis and the Malmquist index. However, they usually neglect carry-over activities between two consecutive terms and only focus on the separate time period independently aiming local optimization in a single period, even if these models can take into account the time change effect. In the actual business world, a long time planning and investment is a subject of great concern. For these cases, single period optimization model is not suitable for performance evaluation. To cope with long time point of view, the dynamic DEA model incorporates carry-over activities into the model and enables us to measure period specific efficiency based on the long time optimization during the whole period. Dynamic DEA model proposed by F{\"{a}}re and Grosskopf is the first innovative contribution for such purpose. In this paper we develop their model in the slacks-based measure (SBM) framework, called dynamic SBM (DSBM). The SBM model is non-radial and can deal with inputs/outputs individually, contrary to the radial approaches that assume proportional changes in inputs/outputs. Furthermore, according to the characteristics of carry-overs, we classify them into four categories, i.e. desirable, undesirable, free and fixed. Desirable carry-overs correspond, for example, to profit carried forward and net earned surplus carried to the next term, while undesirable carry-overs include, for example, loss carried forward, bad debt and dead stock. Free and fixed carry-overs indicate, respectively, discretionary and non-discretionary ones. We develop dynamic SBM models that can evaluate the overall efficiency of decision making units for the whole terms as well as the term efficiencies.},

abstract = {A generic Mediator architecture for distributed task planning and coordination has been developed using multi-agent paradigms. In this approach, agents function autonomously as independent computing processes, and dynamic virtual clusters coordinate the agent's activities and decision making. This coordination involves dynamically created coordination agents and resource agents concurrently. The Mediator architecture contains three levels of these coordination agents: the template mediator, the data-agent manager, and the active mediator. The template mediator is the top-level global coordinator. This agent contains both the templates and the cloning mechanism to create the successively lower-level agents. Task plans are decomposed successively into subtasks, which are allocated to dynamically created agent clusters coordinated through data-agent managers and active mediators. Coordination of agent activity takes place both among the clusters and within each cluster. The system dynamically adapts to evolving manufacturing tasks, with virtual agent clusters being created as needed, and destroyed when their tasks are completed. The mediator architecture and related mechanisms are demonstrated using an intelligent manufacturing scheduling application. Both the machines and the parts involved in this production system are considered as intelligent agents. These agents use a common language protocol based on the Knowledge Query Manipulation Language (KQML). The generic Mediator approach can be used for other distributed organizational systems beyond the intelligent manufacturing application it was originally developed for.},
